One of the problems that I have with my computers is keeping the settings the same across all of them.  I have my desktop, laptop, and work computer and would like to keep things like my bookmarks the same across all of them.

I have been using <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> to keep all my bookmarks and the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">firefox</a> live bookmark feature to access them on each computer.  While is is better than nothing, it leaves much to be desired.

I just ran into a tool from <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> that should make the whole process much better.  It's called <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/">Google Browser Sync</a> and it seems to solve many of the issues.

This is a <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">firefox</a> plugin that you install on each of your computers and it uses your google account to keep certain things synchronized between each of your computers.

At this time they support<ul><li>bookmarks - This is the main thing I wanted</li>
<li>history - Some people might find this useful</li>
<li>cookies - For all the bad rap that cookies get, this is a great feature for web sites that recognize you like <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a></li>
<li>tabs - This is really cool. I could have tabs open on my home desktop, take my laptop to a internet cafe and open firefox to the same exact web site I was working on at home.</li>
<li>saved passwords - This one really scares me, Do we really trust google so blindly?  Sure, don't be evil, but...</li>
</ul>

This is a great start, what would be an incredible enhancement would be the ability to synchronize the installation of other plugins as well as the plugin configurations.  All <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">firefox</a> users know that it's power comes from having lots of plugins installed.  It is difficult to have the same plugins installed and configured on all my instances of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">firefox</a>, so this would be a wonderful addition.{% endraw %}
