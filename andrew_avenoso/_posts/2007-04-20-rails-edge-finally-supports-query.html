title: Rails edge finally supports Query Caching

I just learned about a feature in Rails that I've been wanting for a long time.
In the past, if you were to run two identical database queries in a row, it would hit the database twice<br/>
<code class="prettyprint">
p = Person.find 1
p = Person.find 1
</code><br/><br/>
produces the following logging<br/>
<code class="prettyprint">
Person Load (0.010000)?[0m   ?[0;1mSELECT * FROM people WHERE (people.`id` = 1)
Person Load (0.010000)?[0m   ?[0;1mSELECT * FROM people WHERE (people.`id` = 1)
</code><br/><br/>

If you freeze to the Rails Edge the previous code will now produce this<br/>
<code class="prettyprint">
Person Load (0.010000)?[0m   ?[0;1mSELECT * FROM people WHERE (people.`id` = 1)
CACHE (0.000000)?[0m   ?[0mSELECT * FROM people WHERE (people.`id` = 1)
</code><br/><br/>
So the second call is being pulled from the cache and takes 0.000000 seconds to retrieve

By default this is available when running in a controller or .rhtml
<p>If you want to see this work on the console you can use the cache method </p>
<code class="prettyprint">
Person.cache do
&nbsp;&nbsp;p = Person.find 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;p = Person.find 1
end
</code><br/><br/>

This is by no means a replacement for memcache, but I like it because it increases performance without having to do any additional coding or configuration.
Another thing to remember is that the cache only lasts as long as the request, so you don't need to worry about stale data or cache expiration.

Now... Why would any programmer do a find for the same id multiple times in one request?
You probably won't, but ActiveRecord will.
If you have a highly denormalized database with many lookup tables, this can be a huge performance improvement.
Let's say you have 5 stores, 200 products and 5 product_types
<code class="prettyprint">
<br /><br />s = Store.find 1, :include=&gt;:products
s.products.each { |p| puts "#{p.name} is of type #{p.product_type.name}" }<br /><br /></code>
Doing a <code class="prettyprint">puts</code> is obviously a contrived example, but I often traverse model relationships like this in my views.

Before this feature, these two lines would have produced 201 database queries
Now with Query Caching this will be between 2 and 6 queries.

You might think that you could just add a <code class="prettyprint">:include =&gt; :product_type</code> in your product model.  This works while you're loading products, but not if you've already included products in store.  In other words, it appears that ActiveRecord can only do an <code class="prettyprint">:include</code> one level deep

This is a great way to keep from having to roll your own solution or monkey patch ActiveRecord, I look forward to this feature moving from edge to production.
