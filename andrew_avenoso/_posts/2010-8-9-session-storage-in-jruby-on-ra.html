There are many ways to store sessions in Ruby on Rails, but by using JRuby, we get another option that I think supersedes the common solutions... Using the Java Server's built in session store.<br /><br /><h2>First... The implementation</h2>
This is assuming that you are running JRuby and using a tool like warbler to deploy to a Java server like Tomcat.<br /><br />config/initializers/session_store.rb<br />
{% highlight text %}# check if we're running in a java container
if defined?($servlet_context)
    require 'action_controller/session/java_servlet_store'
    # tell rails to use the java container's session store
    ActionController::Base.session_store = :java_servlet_store
else
    # other session store for development in webrick/mongrel<br />    # setup cookie based session<br />    ActionController::Base.session = {<br />        :key    =&gt; '_dd_session',<br />        :secret =&gt; '&lt;Your really long random secret key&gt;'<br />    }<br />end
{% endhighlight %}This will store your rails session in Tomcat's session store exactly as if you were running a Java web framework.<br />
<br /><h2>Second... Why?</h2>There are a few common solutions starting with the rails default.<br /><br /><b>Cookie Store:</b> This is not very secure, limited in size, and sends a lot of data back and forth to the client. It is strongly recommended to not use this for production systems.<br /><b>File Store:</b> Stores sessions on the file system. Every cookie access involves file system IO. Does not support clustering by default but can be achieved through a SAN or shared storage.<br /><b>ActiveRecord:</b> Stores sessions in the database. Slow due to database IO. Natively supports clustering.<br /><b>Memcached:</b> Stores sessions in Memcached instance. Very popular and works well with clusters. Can run into RAM issues on systems with lots of users. Requires an instance of Memcached running.<br /><b>Java Servlet Store:</b> Works just like your other Java applications. Java Servers can be configured to cluster sessions. Uses the JSESSIONID cookie or url param (in Tomcat)<br /><br /><h2>Conclusion</h2>This won't be the solution for everyone, but if you're deploying a JRuby on Rails app into an infrastructure based on Java, then it provides a simple and efficient solution.<br />
