I'm writing today from the DSSS (Defense Special Security Systems) Conference in San Antonio. We're here showing Clearance Track, our product for security officers that helps organize and automate the clearance processes associated with getting and keeping your employees' clearances.

I was actually a little bit intimidated when we arrived and started setting up our booth yesterday -- our co-exhibitors rolled into the conference with crates taller than me full of degaussers (I had to google degausser), security doors, liquid scanners, extra large safes, alarm systems, and miscellaneous oversized, super-heavy equipment looking like it was taken from the set of a 1970s spy thriller.  

The truth is, we don't have 2,000 pounds of awesomeness at our booth. Not even if you throw in our pop-up display and our booth babes. Our product is software, so our coolest item is a 30" Apple monitor that we borrowed from our CEO's desk on which we display the software. But we're holding our own. We have a product that people *want*. One of our first visitors took one look at Clearance Track and said to my co-worker, "you're my new best friend."

We thought we would come here and meet lots of security officers from small consulting companies like Near Infinity whose security officers were overwhelmed with processing clearances. But in talking to the attendees, we're finding more government folks charged with managing the clearance data for thousands of military or other government personnel. They use JPAS, but find it insufficient to report on and manage the details of their employees' clearances. They're getting by now with Excel spreadsheets, outdated Access databases, filing cabinets, and whatever info they can remember in their heads.

Clearance Track is a great solution for them. It provides a single, organized place to store all of their clearance data. It makes it easy to report on their secure personnel, easy to find documents related to that person's clearance, easy to pass off responsibilities from one security officer to another, easy to remember to renew a badge, easy to run tedious government reports, easy to auto-generate documents... Who doesn't need easy?

So far, the reaction has been great. Lots of people are raving about how helpful Clearance Track would be in their jobs, how user friendly it is, and how much time it would save them. With a day and a half left to go, we're not missing the heavy equipment too much.

And now, if you'll excuse me, I'd better get back to our booth visitors! 

*Clearance Track is a fast, secure way to manage your clearances. By providing a single place to track your investigations, crossovers, badge renewals, briefings, and certs, Clearance Track significantly streamlines the security officer's job and provides a collaborative environment to organize and store employee data. Use it for 4311s, 4414s, 312s, SF-86s, visit certs, annual security refresher briefings, and key government reports.*
