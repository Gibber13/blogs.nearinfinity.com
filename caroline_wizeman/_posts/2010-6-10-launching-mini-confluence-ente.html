We're in San Francisco this week at the Atlassian Summit lunching Mini 
Confluence Enterprise Edition -- a way to access Confluence on your 
iPhone, Blackberry, Palm or Android. <br />
<br />At last year's summit, we released Mini Confluence Personal Edition,
 an iPhone app that individual users can purchase from the app store and
 run based on Confluence's XML-RPC. <br /><br />The new version is a custom 
plugin installed on the server. For people using an iPhone, they still 
download an app from the app store, but with the Enterprise Edition, 
it's free. For people with other mobile devices, they get to Mini 
Confluence through a web client. <br />
<br />This year's version is two times as fast as the original (!), and 
has some cool new features like filtering on the dashboard based on your
 favorites, status updates, landscape mode, and multiple user accounts.

<br />We've been talking to lots of the conference attendees the past 
couple 
of days. Some of them have already been using the personal edition, and 
have given us feedback on that. Other people have ideas for MCEE, like 
an iPad version, support for Confluence instances protected by VPN, and 
even "make Mini Jira!"<br /><br />I'm surprised by how many people here are 
on Android. It's still mostly 
iPhones, but a lot less Blackberry users than last year. <br />
<br />
A lot 
of people have been signing up for the<a href="http://www.miniconfluence.com/get-it#beta"> beta program </a>-- we're sending out
 copies of the plugin for free to anyone who's interested and letting 
them try it out for three months. I'm anxious to hear the feedback so we
 can improve it before people start paying for it. <br />
<br />If you try it out, let us know what you think!<br /><br />And now... I 
think it's time for some Ghirardelli Chocolate :-)
