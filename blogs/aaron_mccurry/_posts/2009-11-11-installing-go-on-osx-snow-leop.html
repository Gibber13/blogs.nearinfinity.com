 Go is a new experimental language that has been released by Google that is suppose to have nearly the speed of C while executing, without a lot of the normal headaches of C/C++ coding.&nbsp; For example Go has garbage collection, dynamic types, reflections, etc. see <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/11/Go-Google-New-Language">Google Experiments With A New Language, Go</a> for a good overview.&nbsp; So after reading a few things about it, I wanted to try it out, and here is how I got it working on my 64-bit OSX machine.<br /><br />It's pretty basic, all I did was follow the instructions <a href="http://golang.org/doc/install.html">here</a>.<br /><br />First I added:<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint">export GOROOT=$HOME/go<br />export GOOS=darwin<br />export GOARCH=amd64<br />export GOBIN=$HOME/gobin<br />export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN</pre>
to ~/.bash_profile<br /><br />Run:<br /><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">. ~/.bash_profile</pre>
Next:<br /><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">sudo easy_install mercurial</pre>
This took a while for me to pull mercurial down, maybe their server was having problems. <br /><br />Note: I had to install the Xcode.mpkg from the Optional Installs on my Snow Leopard DVD to get gcc-4.3 installed.<br /><br />Next:<br /><br />

<pre class="prettyprint">hg clone -r release https://go.googlecode.com/hg/ $GOROOT</pre>
Next:<br /><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">cd $GOROOT/src<br />./all.bash</pre>
Note: One of the http tests goes out and touches google.com, I had to drop the firewall while building everything.&nbsp; After the build and tests were complete I turned it back on.<br /><br />And that's it! Time to make a hello world program.<br /><br />Create hello.go:<br /><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">package main<br /><br />import fmt "fmt"<br /><br />func main() {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; fmt.Printf("hello world!\n");<br />}</pre>
Compile and Link:<br /><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">6g hello.go<br />6l hello.6</pre>
Run:<br /><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">./6.out</pre>
Output:<br /><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">hello world!</pre>
I am very excited about Go can't wait to write something real with it!<br /><br />
