So most developers, especially Java developers because of its verbose syntax, have played around with generated code at one point or another.  For those of you who haven't, it is a very, very, very easy concept to understand.
<br/>

<br/>
<h3>The most pathetic diagram you will ever see</h3>
<pre class="code">
Inputs -> Generator -> Generated
</pre>

<br/>
Some inputs, a template and some values for example, are passed into a generator and it generates some output.  This could really be anything; XML, source files, view components, etc.  One of the first rules of generators is do not modify the generated content.  Why you ask?  Playing devil's advocate, I could say that once the material is generated I won't ever need to generate again.  Any changes to the material I make will already be present so they will build on top of each other. In some, possibly even many, cases this is very true. However, there are times when you will want to regenerate something or to generate another object that may require many of the same changes that you already made to previously generated objects.  All of those changes have to be made to the generated material one at a time because the generator does not support them.
<br/>

<br/>Well, OK, it may be acceptable to modify generated content when you are testing something out because it might be much faster than going through the entire generation process again.  But beware, your changes are not repeatable and will be lost as soon as the generator runs again.  So the general rule of thumb is, modify the inputs, not the generated material.
<br/>

<br/>
Let's introduce one additional component, some sort of runtime environment.  
<br/>

<br/>
<h3>Pathetic diagram + Runtime</h3>
<pre class="code">
Inputs -> Generator -> Generated  <= Runtime
</pre>
<br/>

<br/>
This pathetic chain symbolizes the same thing, but at the end of the process some "runtime" uses the generated objects.  So, why would you ever modify the generated material aside from some quick step to verify that the generated material was ok in the context of the runtime?  Well, its probably not a good idea.  You are much better off modifying the inputs, thus creating a repeatable process.
<br/>

<br/>
Now, let's introduce a wrinkle to all this lovely over-simplification.  What if the generator or runtime needs to be updated and is not fully backwards compatible? Well, if the runtime is updated then the generated objects have to be updated to work with the new runtime.  If you modified the generated objects then you will either have to continue down this path or you will have to modify your inputs to update your generated objects with not only the new changes required by the updated runtime but also the changes you made prior to the upgrade.  
<br/>

<br/>
If the generator is updated, then we have to change the inputs.  Any changes that were made to the generated objects will be lost.  
<br/>

<br/>
So here is the important question.  Why in the world am I harping on all this hypothetical drivel?  Well, because if you are using Rails or Grails as your web framework then most likely you are doing exactly what I am suggesting is a bad idea.  Readers familiar with g/rails might say that this is not true because of the scaffolding support offered in both frameworks.  But this leads to my exact point.  Using scaffolding is good, but it only takes you so far.  At some point you have to move beyond what you get out of the box.  At this point, users are expected to go modify the generated material and hope that they never need to generate again.  To me, using generators to get started is a good idea, but once you move away from the scaffolding you have crossed the point of no return.  
<br/>

<br/>
So what can be done to prevent modifying generated code?  Well, just like I suggested in my verbose drivel above, modify the inputs!  In grails, for example, this means providing your changes not to the generated content, but in plug-ins that determine how your content is generated.  Now, I don't believe that grails plug-ins are robust enough at the moment (I could be wrong about this) to really make this feasible, but I would like to see g/rails adopt this type of pattern.  Both frameworks have strong runtime environments and very good generators.  But let's change the focus from modifying the generated content to modifying the inputs so we have a repeatable code generation framework.
