title: REST vs. SOAP vs. POX vs. TBD

I have jumped into the fray of trying to sort out REST from SOAP from POX. Here are my initial opinions:
<p><b>REST</b>:  Fielding's introduction [<a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/seths?entry=building_an_online_spreadsheet_using#chpt5">1</a>] lays out constraints and why they are important. I was hoping the subsequent chapter [<a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/seths?entry=building_an_online_spreadsheet_using#chpt6">2</a>] focusing on REST and HTTP would have implementation level details on "what" to do. What I got out of it was Fielding reminiscing on the good, bad, and the ugly of HTTP 1.0 and 1.1. It was a serious mistake for me to expect a doctoral thesis to also be "REST for dummies." Still, the voice from on high seems to have defined the goal without clearing a trail to follow. </p><p>This site [<a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/seths?entry=building_an_online_spreadsheet_using#restwiki">3</a>] was very helpful. I'm looking forward to adding this book [<a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/seths?entry=building_an_online_spreadsheet_using#crummy">4</a>] to my Safari bookshelf.
</p><p><b>SOAP &amp; WS-*:</b>  SOAP has a wealth of concrete documentation and libraries. Developers have spent a lot of time building tools to help the development process. All this sounds great! But... something about all the flux [<a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/seths?entry=building_an_online_spreadsheet_using#soaponarope">5</a>] and xml all the way down made my spidey-sense tingle.
</p><p>I have written client code for an efficient, robust, and scalable family of network applications [<a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/seths?entry=building_an_online_spreadsheet_using#oscar">6</a>]. That protocol family exists because other parts of the business subsidised its architects, developers, testers, hardware, and bandwidth. Also necessary was the hands-off management style which gave the architecture time and space to grow naturally. This leads me to doubt success for the volunteer cooks [<a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/seths?entry=building_an_online_spreadsheet_using#cooks">7</a>] in the WS-I kitchen. Hopefully their contributions will improve the general state of web services. 
</p><p><b>POX: </b> Plain ol' XML. Not sure this term means more than that... SOAP/WS-* are XML all the way down. XML may also be part of a REST solution -- ROX anyone? :)
