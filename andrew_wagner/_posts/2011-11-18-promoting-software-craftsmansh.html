Many people have tried to define software craftsmanship. Corey Haines&nbsp;<a href="http://programmingtour.blogspot.com/2011/03/my-talk-from-scna2010.html">likes to talk about</a>&nbsp;being positive as part of your profession. Avdi Grimm, in the&nbsp;<a href="http://avdi.org/talks/confident-code-rubymidwest-2011/confident-code.html">Confident Code</a>&nbsp;talk he's been giving, talks similarly about how clean code is more enjoyable to work with.&nbsp;Bob Martin points out that&nbsp;<a href="http://cleancoder.posterous.com/software-craftsmanship-things-wars-commandmen">nobody likes writing bad code</a>.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>So I think that a lot of the Software Craftsmanship is about enjoying writing code. It's about building something that you can be proud of. Generally, it's about being happy to be a developer.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>One of the keys to this is to learn a lot of different techniques, and to get good at the techniques that you do know. If you're using the right tools, and using them correctly, it will go a long way towards enjoying what you do. After all, would you rather cut wood by hand with a hacksaw, or with a circular saw?</div><div><br /></div><div>To that end, Near Infinity is sponsoring and hosting a local Code Retreat on&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.coderetreat.com/global-day-of-coderetreat">the upcoming Global Day of Code Retreat</a>, December 3rd. The idea behind the event is to work on the same programming problem, repeatedly, all day long. After each cycle of working on the problem, you throw away your code and start all over again. This has a really powerful effect - you no longer get attached to having your code, and finishing the problem. Instead, you focus on <i>how you&nbsp;</i>write the code. Plus, you're pairing with a different person each session, potentially with a different programming language. So you get to see a lot of different approaches - different tools - and how to use them, both well and poorly.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, if you're interested,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1756063433">check out the details</a>, and sign up!</div><div><br /></div>
