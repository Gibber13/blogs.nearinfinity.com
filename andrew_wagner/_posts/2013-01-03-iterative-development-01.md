<p>With this blog post, I’m officially kicking off a new long-running screencast series! Yay! I really am excited about this, but first let me give a big shout-out to <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/">Near Infinity</a>, which is a great place to work. Awesome benefits, smart and talented people, and very interesting work.</p>

<p>So, what’s this screencast series going to be about? The main theme is iterative software development - I’ll be building a 2D game library iteratively, one feature per screencast. I won’t be teaching Java syntax, but I will be teaching you how to keep your code organized and flexible so that you can go whatever direction you need to.</p>

<p>I’ll be using an architecture called “Component, Entity, System” for this project. There’s lots of great information out there about this, but I’ll go ahead and define the terms here for convenience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Component - A chunk of related data, such as a point (with an x and y value). Little-to-no logic</li>
  <li>Entity - An ID list of components. Little-to-nothing else, including logic.</li>
  <li>System - Logic (finally!) that acts on a set of entities.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s enough of an intro for now. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/arwagner/gameengine">github repository here</a>. Please <a href="mailto:awagner@nearinfinity.com">email me feedback</a>; I will be happy to take it into account. I’m hoping to release a video or two each week, so tell me what you want to see! Here’s the first video:</p>
