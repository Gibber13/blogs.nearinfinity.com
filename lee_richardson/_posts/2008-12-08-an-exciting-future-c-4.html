<p>Last week I attended the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devkeydet/archive/2008/12/05/follow-up-reston-developer-conference-04dec08.aspx">Public Sector Developer Conference in Reston, Virginia</a>. 
    Summary: I can barely contain my excitement for just about everything Microsoft 
    is doing right now for software development. In particular the first talk "<a href="http://lrvsww.bay.livefilestore.com/y1plQsNGQIdpRNBM9vujeHGiFcpyjsTAY8KSUmzLBLX-Sn23H-zSo_-UY7R7ks8ShJ5QplLlmcB3ug/marcscNETFX4.0VS2010Overview.pptx?download">What I've learned about Visual Studio 2010, .NET Framework 4.0 (and beyond), Silverlight 3 (and beyond)</a>" 
    was so exciting I almost gave a standing ovation.</p>

<p><b>What Marc learned about Visual Studio 2010, .NET Framework 4.0, Silverlight 3</b></p>
<p>So believe it or not this talk by <a href="http://devkeydet.com/">Marc Schweigert</a> (who is a fabulous presenter 
    by the way) was a 90 minute distillation of <i>everything</i> that happened at <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com/">PDC</a> (which sadly I missed).  Consequently it flew like a jet engine, gave barely a minute or two to every topic, and required either massive amounts of caffeine or a good amount of prerequisite reading.  Fortunately I had both.</p>
<p>To summarize the presentation I'll just give my favorite upcoming technologies 
    and sort it roughly in decreasing level of my excitement:</p>
<p>Technology: <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/14/new-asp-net-dynamic-data-support.aspx">ASP.Net MVC Dynamic Data</a>
<br />Overview: Ruby on Rails for .Net
<br />Impressions: As if ASP.Net MVC wasn't cool enough.  This looks awesome! I want to try it on a real project.</p>
<p>Technology: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO.NET_Data_Services">ADO.Net Data Services (Astoria)</a>
<br />Overview: Expose LINQ ORM data (e.g. LINQ to Entities) to web services, now 
    with better BLOB support
<br />Impressions: Powerful, exciting (just a little scary)</p>
<p>Technology: Astoria Offline
<br />Overview: Write disconnected apps that sync to ADO.Net Data Services
<br />Impressions: Frikin' awesome. I can't wait to see/write disconnected apps.</p>
<p>Technology: <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx">ASP.Net AJAX - jQuery Support</a>
<br />Overview: ASP.Net will abandon its custom "roll your own" JavaScript framework 
    and adopt a leading open source one .<br />Impressions: Amazing.  I couldn't be happier.</p>
<p>Technology: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/BB30/">Live Mesh Web Apps</a>
<br />Overview: Offline capable, in browser or on desktop apps (HTML/AJAX or Silverlight) that run "in the mesh"
<br />Impressions: Wow, this is some really cool stuff, I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this technology</p>
<p>Technology: SharePoint Integration 
<br />Overview: Build web parts, wsp files, etc directly in VS without an add-on
<br />Impressions: Fantastic!  Awesome!  This was a major point.</p>
<p>Technology: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_Parallel_Library#TPL">Task Parallel Library (TPL)</a>
<br />Overview: Simplify parallelization and avoid programming in threads by using delegates
<br />Impressions: This looks absolutely amazing, I can't wait</p>
<p>Technology: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163329.aspx">Parallel LINQ</a>
<br />Overview: Parallelize LINQ queries
<br />Impressions: So easy, so powerful, so exiting</p>
<p>Technology: 
    <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2008/11/10/clr-4.0-in-process-side-by-side-clr-hosting.aspx">In Process Side By Side Model</a>
<br />Overview: Run both 2.0 and 4.0 CLR code in the same process
<br />Impressions: Wow.  Minimize existing app upgrade pain; free developers to use new features in old code bases; free language designers more flexibility in refactoring the C# language.</p>
<p>Technology: 
    <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=csharpfuture&amp;DownloadId=3550">C# 4.0</a>
<br />Overview:  Named optional parameters and dynamic types
<br />Impressions: Named parameters: cool, dynamic types: controversial, but I suspect a very good thing</p>
<p>Technology: <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">F#</a>
<br />Overview: Functional programming language to ship by default with VS
<br />Impressions: I'm playing with this now, it's very interesting, but I'm not prepared to comment yet</p>
<p>Technology: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MEF">Managed Extensibility Framework</a>
<br />Overview: Massively simplify creating desktop app add-on frameworks.
<br />Impressions: This has the potential to change desktop apps to very light containers that load functionality as necessary.  I am hopeful and excited.</p>
<p>Technology: VS 2010 IDE Improvements
<br />Overview: WPF &amp; XAML Editor better, Multi-Monitor Support, Built on WPF
<br />Impressions: Cool, looking forward to trying.  I like the dog-food approach, although as I've pointed out earlier <a href="http://rapidapplicationdevelopment.blogspot.com/2008/11/id-prefer-to-post-positive-happy-or.html">dog-food isn't everything</a>.</p>
<p>Technology: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/efdesign/">ADO.Net Entity Framework V2</a>
<br />Overview: The DBMS agnostic LINQ based ORM now with N-tier improvement, DDL generation, caching
<br />Impressions: DDL generation was interesting, but apparently won't support deltas, that's for another product, maybe Oslo.  Caching support looks fabulous.</p>
<p>Technology: 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a>
<br />Overview: WPF to have more controls, better usability in VS, and simplify ribbon programming 
<br />Impressions: Cool, but .. am I the only person who hates the ribbon?</p>
<p>Technology: 
    <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/11/16/update-on-silverlight-2-and-a-glimpse-of-silverlight-3.aspx">Silverlight 3</a>
<br />Overview: 3D &amp; GPU support; will work as well as WPF in VS; H.264 support
<br />Impressions: 3D = Very cool; VS WPF = Cool, although I may still program in XAML; and H dot two sixty what?</p>
<p>Technology: Web Development
    in VS 2010<br />Overview: JavaScript intellisence improvements; view-state improvement, Deployment simplified (e.g. Web.Production.Config &amp; setup packages); new controls (chart)
<br />Impressions: Very nice.</p>
<p>Technology: 
    <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy/archive/2008/07/30/using-client-templates-part-1.aspx">ASP.Net AJAX - Client Templates</a>
<br />Overview: Simplifying AJAX without an UpdatePanel
<br />Impressions: I'm lazy so I'll probably stick with UpdatePanel &amp; server based approach, but I'm very happy to see the new client based focus as an additional option</p>
<p>Technology: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Workflow_Foundation">Workflow Foundation (WF)</a>
<br />Overview: More controls, faster, better debugging
<br />Impressions: I haven't really had a need for it WF, but the enhancements sound good.</p>
<p>Technology: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL23/">Oslo</a>
<br />Overview: Create DSLs that do things
    like help manage databases<br />Impressions: I fail to see what problem this solves, but <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Oslo.html">Martin Fowler thinks it's cool</a>, so I'll keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>Technology: 
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/dataservices/default.aspx">SQL Data Services</a>
<br />Overview: Basically Amazon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Simple_Storage_Service">S3 </a> (cloud stuff)
<br />Impressions: In case you didn't know <a href="http://rapidapplicationdevelopment.blogspot.com/2007/07/referential-integrity-data-modeling.html"> I love referential integrity</a>, so I'm not a big fan.  What did impress me is Microsoft will merge the LINQ serialization approach with ADO.Net Data Services.  Nice benefit to multiple technologies within one company.</p>
<b>Summary</b>

<p>There's so much going on it's a little overwhelming and I'm sure I missed stuff, but you can see why 
    I'm so excited.  I vow to never miss a PDC again.&nbsp; Anyway I hope this post helped 
    clear up the vast amount of exciting new technologies coming out soon.</p>
