<p>Just a heads up that DevX just published an article of mine today. The article is entitled <a href="http://www.devx.com/dotnet/Article/35070">Sync Your Database to SharePoint Using SSIS</a>. The article covers how to import and export SharePoint list items using Collaborative Application Markup Language (CAML), SharePoint's web services API, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Integration_Services">SQL Server Integration Services</a>.</p>
<p>The latter half of the article is a fairly detailed how-to, but the former half covers what SharePoint lists are, what SSIS is, and why you would want to use them all together. I hope you find the article useful, and feel free to comment here if you have thoughts on the article.</p>
