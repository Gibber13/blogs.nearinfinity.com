NIC Blogs
===========

Setup Repository
----------------

```
# Clone the repo
git clone --recursive git@github.com:nearinfinity/blogs.nearinfinity.com.git
cd blogs.nearinfinity.com
```

Creating a blog
---------------

```
# If this is your first blog
rake blog:directory

# Cd to your directory
cd {firstname}_{lastname}
# Follow the on screen instructions to create your new blog post
rake blog:create
# And begin Editting your new blog
```
A blog can be written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), HTML, and [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/). You can edit the generated front yaml to make any necessary changes.

Editing Your Profile
----------------

As part of Near Infinity's new site and blogging system you now have your own profile page. This is your personal space to professionally express yourself. Each profile has two sections, an about you list (the front yaml) and the bio at the bottom. The bio portion is written in standard html. If you wish to edit the about you section and also wish to use a ':' then you need to surround the value with quotations (otherwise it causes compile errors). For example:
```
title: A Great Title
# This title with a colon would need to be
title: "A Greater Title: Part 2"
```

Syntax Highlighting
-------------------

    {% highlight <language> %}
    def to_s
      "#{name}"
    end
    {% endhighlight %}

Highlighting with Line Numbers

    {% highlight <language> linenos %}

View the list of [languages](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/) or use the command:
