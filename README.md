NIC Blogs
===========

Setup Repository
----------------

```
# Clone the repo
git clone --recursive git@github.com:nearinfinity/blogs.nearinfinity.com.git
cd blogs.nearinfinity.com
```

Creating a blog
---------------

```
# If this is your first blog
rake blog:directory

# Cd to your directory
cd {firstname}_{lastname}
# Follow the on screen instructions to create your new blog post
rake blog:create
# And begin Editting your new blog
```
A blog can be written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), HTML, and [Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/). You can edit the generated front yaml to make any necessary changes.

Editing Your Profile
----------------

As part of Near Infinity's new site and blogging system you now have your own profile page. Your profile is located at /user_name/index.html. This is your personal space to professionally express yourself. Each profile has two sections: an about you section (the front yaml) and a bio section. The bio section is written in standard html. Your profile page can also be written as markdown but you must rename the file index.md. If you add a line to your about you section that contains a colon, you need to surround the entire string in quotes (otherwise it causes compile errors). For example:
```
title: A Great Title

title: "A Greater Title: Part 2"  # This title needs to be surrounded in quotes
```

Syntax Highlighting
-------------------

    {% highlight <language> %}
    def to_s
      "#{name}"
    end
    {% endhighlight %}

Highlighting with Line Numbers

    {% highlight <language> linenos %}

View the list of [languages](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/) or use the command:
