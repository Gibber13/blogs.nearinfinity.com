<P>Here at Near Infinity, we hold conferences and technical talks often. With all the effort and resources that go into planning and holding these educational forums, it is important that we are able to reach our largest audience. Of course, we have our awesomely equipped and spacious conference room, but what about all those hungry souls who are not within our confines? Those who are outside, out of our reach - shall they remain in the darkness, unenlightened?

<P>Live online video streaming is hardly a new thing. However, the quality and cost of ad-free video streaming has often proved to be discouraging to users who wished to have an affordable, high-quality, as well as a fully customizable platform for live video streaming. 

<P>In mid-2011, Amazon announced the launch of live streaming services using Amazon’s CloudFront and Adobe Flash Media Server. It was a groundbreaking announcement in the world of live video.

<P>So what makes streaming with Amazon CloudFront any different than Ustream or Livestream? A lot! Fully customizable and scalable, as well as the most cost effective. When streaming with Amazon CloudFront, you have full control over the live streaming server - running Adobe Flash Media Server - so you can configure your stream’s encoding properties as well as bandwidth settings to provide the best viewing experience for online users. Best of all, through Amazon Web Services, there are no contracts, no commitment, and you pay only for the resources consumed.

<P>Check out the information and tutorials below. And expect your favorite NIC Tech Talk speaker coming to a live stream near you!
