<p>Ryan spent five years at Virginia Tech and graduated in 2012 cum laude with a degree in Computer Engineering.  
Since then he has worked as a software developer at Near Infinity Corporation with web, mobile, and big data technologies.  
In his free time he always has some robotics parts littering his workbench, a guitar at hand nearby to play some tunes, 
and his cleats around to play soccer at a moment's notice.</p>
