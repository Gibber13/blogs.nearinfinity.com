Last Thursday we published version 1.1 of [Mini Confluence](http://www.miniconfluence.com), which includes a new release of the Confluence plugin and iPhone client. The new plugin is available immediately, while the iPhone client will likely be published to the App Store within a week or two. But, you won't get any of the new features without updating the plugin, so do that now.

View Diffs/Changes to Pages and News
--------------------------------------------------
One really cool feature in this release is the ability to view historical changes of a page or news item. You'll now see a "View change..." link just below the author's name on any page or news item. Tapping that link will bring up the change view shown here.

Swiping left to right will take you to older versions of the content while swiping right to left will return you to newer versions. The view for each version shows what changed from the previous version. Additionally, tapping the View button at the top right will show you the rendered content of the specific version for which you're viewing the changes. It's pretty cool!

Please see the [Mini Confluence 1.1 Release blog post](http://www.miniconfluence.com/blog/2010/12/09/mini_confluence_1.1_released.html) for full details on everything that changed in the new version.
