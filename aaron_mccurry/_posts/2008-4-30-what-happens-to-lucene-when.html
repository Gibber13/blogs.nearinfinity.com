<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">My current project has some unique
searching requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Fuzzy searching is a must
	(Soundex, Levenshtein, etc.)</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Has to be fast, a must with any
	searching solution</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Has to provide access control</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Full data load indexing needs to
	be completed in a reasonable amount of time</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Scoring needs to be a custom
	implementation</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Needs to run on a predetermined
	environment, meaning that new hardware purchases are not going to
	happen any time soon</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">And last but not least is ability
	do all these things on a dataset that exceeds a billion records</p>
</li></ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">So we have had a lot of constraints to
deal with, the hardest one by far is the last one.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">1 billion
	plus records</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Over 30
	million unique terms</p>
</li></ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<h2>Indexing and Searching Server Specs</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">20 CPUs</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">32 Gig of ram</p>
	</li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Dedicated SAN
	storage</p>
</li></ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<h2>First Searching Experiences</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">After getting the
index built in multiple partitions, I fired up a simple Lucene
console to do some simple searches with a Lucene multi searcher.  Ran
out of memory with 2 Gig heap, tried the maximum heap size for the 32
bit JVM we were using, 3.3 Gig, and that ran out of memory as well. 
So, initial tries to just run one search were unsuccessful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Then we installed
a 64-bit JVM and tried an 8 Gig heap, and it worked!  I could run
searches and after the first couple of warm up searches it was
getting 20 - 80 ms responses on single term searches.  Great,
but then we tried a Fuzzy search, which uses a Levenshtein algorithm
to calculate matches, 2 minutes 45 seconds, this was unacceptable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Next we wrote our
own Levenshtein Lucene query and got the 2 minutes plus search down
to about one second.  We found that the built in Lucene Fuzzy query
was taking 85-95% of the time to find the terms to search.  Then
after those terms were found the actual search with those expanded
terms only took a second to two depending on how many terms were
found.  So we replaced the built in Fuzzy query with a custom one
that gets near instantaneous results on Levenshtein fuzzy matches. 
Problem solved.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<h2>Indexing Time</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">After our initial
proof of concept was complete, we needed to improve the indexing time
down to something more reasonable.  The index creation from scratch
was taking 36 - 48 hours to build with 20 CPUs running at 100%
utilization.  Which means that the machine was indexing about 9,000
records a second.  Not bad for Lucene 2.2, but not that great.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">First we stopped
merging the indexes after we created them, that by itself was taking
about 12 hours.  At this point we also started searching these
multiple indexes in parallel, and we are seeing modest increases in
query performance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Second, we
upgraded to Lucene 2.3, this provided a huge increase in indexing
speed.  Our index creation time went from 36 - 48 hours
(depending on if we merged indexes or not) down to 3-4 hours.  The
indexing process is now indexing around 125,000+ records a second. 
Huge improvement, if you haven't upgraded to 2.3, you should!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<h2>Current Development</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We are in the
process of adding access control to Lucene as well as adding new
custom queries and scoring.  So far Lucene has performed better than
any of the competition that it has come up against, and with it's
price point it seems to have won acceptance on our project.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In upcoming parts
I will go into more details about the technical solutions that we
have developed to solve these problems, as well others that I haven't
mentioned yet.</p>
