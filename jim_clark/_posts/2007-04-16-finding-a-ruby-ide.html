title: Finding a Ruby IDE

<p>
  Recently I've spent some time revisiting and learning more about Ruby on
  Rails. In doing so I wanted a decent editor to work with.&nbsp; This article
  is about my "adventure" in finding an editor and/or IDE that I could use in
  exploring and learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails and ultimately what I ended up
  selecting.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  Everything I read online talked about
  <a href="http://macromates.com/" title="TextMate">TextMate</a> the editor of
  choice for Mac Ruby developers. I have a Windows machine so I didn't have that
  option. I decided to stick close to home by seeing if IntelliJ (my favorite
  Java editor) had a plug-in that supported Ruby. At the time no such plug-in
  existed. I gave SciTE and FreeRIDE (the editors that come with the Ruby
  distribution) a spin but wanted something a little closer to what I was use to
  in a Java IDE. I remember hearing something about RadRails, a Ruby IDE based
  on Eclipse. I was familiar enough with Eclipse so I decided to use that for my
  dabbling. I used this for a while and it was OK for what I was doing.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  In the meantime I came across a Windows TextMate-like editor called "e". I
  first installed a beta version of "e" which stands for the
  "<a href="http://e-texteditor.com/" title="E Text Editor">E Text Editor</a> ".
  I spent some time trying to make this editor work for me. I wanted to see what
  all the excitement was about in the TextMate world, even if it was on Windows
  :-) . To use "e" I first needed an updated installation of
  <a href="http://www.cygwin.com" title="cygwin">cygwin</a> since "e" relies on
  cygwin to function. I wasn't overly pleased that "e" relied on cygwin to be a
  functional editor. Nevertheless I installed a recent copy of cygwin and was up
  and running with "e". "e" is in beta and with beta software comes annoyances
  and partially functional software. I really wanted to make this editor
  work.&nbsp; However, I ran in to a few bugs that prohibited me from using "e"
  and caused me to resume using RadRails. About this time, the IntelliJ folks
  released a Ruby plug-in.
</p>

<p>
  The IntelliJ plug-in worked fairly well for what I needed. I could use it in
  an environment that I was very familiar with and was happy to be "home".
  Initially I experienced some minor bugs. The biggest problem I had was the
  plug-in can only be used in IntelliJ 6+ and I currently run 5.1 and wasn't
  prepared to upgrade. Unlike other editors I had looked at IntelliJ is
  relatively more expensive.&nbsp; After my 30 day license expired, I headed
  back to RadRails, but then I ran in to this blog post about the future of
  RadRails:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
  "<font face="Tahoma, sans-serif"><font color="#1f1f1f">The bottom line to all
  of this is that Matt and I can't provide the same kind of commitment that we
  once could. Like or not, RadRails is not a business. We've been working our
  asses off on a start-up for the past few months and RadRails has suffered as a
  result. I wish things were different and we could sit back and work on open
  source all day but that is just not the reality anymore.</font></font>"
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  I wanted to use software where I felt there was community support. I continued
  my search to see what else was available. I came across
  <a href="http://intype.info/home/index.php" title="InType">InType</a>, a very
  basic editor that is suppose to be TextMate-like, however, at the time of the
  writing they were still in an alpha version and didn't seem to have much
  momentum. At the time I used the software it was still very immature (e.g. no
  tab support though you can open multiple windows). Then one day I read a blog
  entry about Ruby support in NetBeans. IÃ•d always associated NetBeans with the
  so-so Java IDE currently produced by Sun.
</p>

<p>
  I downloaded a
  <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/MilestoneDownloads" title="milestone release">milestone
  release</a> of NetBeans release 6 and installed support for Ruby and Ruby on
  Rails. Almost instantly I was wowed by their support for Ruby and Rails. I had
  no trouble becoming productive with the IDE and have been happy with the
  product since.&nbsp; Current features include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Code completion
  </li>
  <li>
    Occurrence highlighting
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrated documentation pop-ups for Ruby API calls
  </li>
  <li>
    Parameter completion
  </li>
  <li>
    Mongrel support
  </li>
  <li>
    Rake migrations
  </li>
  <li>
    And much
    <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/RubyRecentChanges" title="more">more</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Additionally, NetBeans supports development in either the reference
  implementation of Ruby or in
  <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/" title="JRuby">JRuby</a>, a Java
  implementation of the Ruby interpreter.&nbsp; Most recently the NetBeans folks
  have begun adding
  <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tor/entry/ruby_screenshot_of_the_week7" title="support">support</a>
  for TextMate bundles. They have also created a
  <a href="http://deadlock.nbextras.org/hudson/job/ruby/" title="stripped down version">stripped
  down version</a> of the IDE that is strictly for Ruby coding (though this
  still seems a little rough around the edges). As you can see the NetBeans
  folks are really putting forth a great deal of effort to create a solid,
  robust IDE for creating Ruby and Ruby on Rails applications. While the
  RadRails IDE is now supported by
  <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" title="Aptana">Aptana</a> and
  <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/" title="IntelliJ 7">IntelliJ
  7</a> will include built in Ruby support (release expected by the end of the
  year), NetBeans has made a big leap ahead of the rest of the pack and nothing
  appears to be getting in their way. For now NetBeans is the choice for me when
  doing Ruby development.
