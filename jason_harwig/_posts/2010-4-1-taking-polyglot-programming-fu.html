title: Taking Polyglot Programming Further

<p>I consider polyglot programming to be using the best tool for the problem. Some languages are&nbsp;inherently&nbsp;better at solving certain types of problems. We should embrace these advantages and switch freely between languages.

<p>Today, we are introducing Hydra, the meta-language that runs on the JVM. Hydra supports (and encourages!) any JVM-based language at any time in the file.

<p>Example: Person.hyrdra

{% highlight text %}:groovy
class Person {

  :ruby
  # define properties
  attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name

  :python
  """ 
    Get the full name by concatenating first, last
  """
  def full_name (self):
    print "%s %s" % (self.first_name, self.last_name)

  :java
  /**
   * Set the firstName attribute to name. (Useless javadoc)
   *
   * @param name the new first name value
   */
  public void setFirstName(String name) {
      String prefix = "Setting first name to ";

      :clojure
      (print prefix)
      (defn printChar [c] (print c))

      :javascript
      name.forEach(printChar);<br />
      :java
      this.firstName = name;      
  }

  // Switch to python so ending '}' isn't needed ;)
  :python{% endhighlight %}
