title: Mock NSDate (or other) class methods

<p>Today I ran into an issue unit testing a method that called <code>[NSDate date]</code>. How could I test arbitrary dates without modifying the code under test?</p>

<p>I found a blog post <code>about</code> <a href="http://thom.org.uk/2009/05/09/mocking-class-methods-in-objective-c/">Mocking class methods</a> that uses an objective-c runtime technique called method swizzling.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
- (void)setUp {
  [super setUp];
  Method originalDate = class_getClassMethod([NSDate class], @selector(date));
  Method mockDate = class_getInstanceMethod([self class], @selector(mockDate));
  method_exchangeImplementations(originalDate, mockDate);
}
- (NSDate *)mockDate { 
  return [NSDate distantPast]; 
}
</pre>

<p>Pretty cool. Using <code>method_exchangeImplementations</code> we swapped the class method for the instance method in our test! This example shows always returning the distantPast, but I wanted to be able to change what it would return. 

<p>My first attempt was to return an instance variable from <code>mockDate</code>, but that didn't work because when that method runs it's running inside of <code>NSDate</code> as a class method. It no longer is part of the test instance.

<p>That's when I thought of another runtime feature of objective-c &mdash; <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Chapters/ocAssociativeReferences.html">Associative References</a>. An object can have pieces of metadata attached to it using <code>objc_setAssociatedObject</code> and <code>objc_getAssociatedObject</code>. This allows us to attach a date to the <code>NSDate</code> class object.

<p>Here's what I came up with to finish my <code>NSDate</code> mock.

<pre class="prettyprint">

static char mockDateKey;

- (void)setUp
{
  [super setUp];

  // Start by having the mock return the test startup date
  [self setMockDate:[NSDate date]];
    
  // Save these as instance variables so test teardown can swap the implementation back
  originalDateMethod = class_getClassMethod([NSDate class], @selector(date));
  mockDateMethod = class_getInstanceMethod([self class], @selector(mockDateSwizzle));
  method_exchangeImplementations(originalDateMethod, mockDateMethod);	    
}

- (void)tearDown
{ 
  // Revert the swizzle   
  method_exchangeImplementations(mockDateMethod, originalDateMethod);	
  [super tearDown];
}

// Mock Method, replaces [NSDate date]
- (NSDate *)mockDateSwizzle {    
    return objc_getAssociatedObject([NSDate class], &mockDateKey);
}

// Convenience method so tests can set want they want [NSDate date] to return
- (void)setMockDate:(NSDate *)aMockDate {
    objc_setAssociatedObject([NSDate class], &mockDateKey, aMockDate, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN);    
}

- (void)testMethodThatUsesDate {
    NSDate *epoch = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970:0];
    [self setMockDate:epoch];
    STAssertEqualObjects([NSDate date], epoch, @"dates should be the same");

    // ... call class that uses [NSDate date]
}
</pre>
