<p><img style="float: right;" src="/blogs/resources/jharwig/firebug-timeline.gif" alt=" "/>Looks like Joe Hewitt has been busy. </p>

<p>Firebug now has it's own site at <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com">getfirebug.com</a>. The new site shows the features for Firebug 1.0 which seem like a giant leap in functionality from the current 0.4.1.  My favorites look to be the new profiler and the network activity view (shown right).</p>

<p>The catch?  According to <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/introducing_fir.php">Hewitt's blog</a>, it might not be free. I know I would pay $15-$25, what about you?</p>
