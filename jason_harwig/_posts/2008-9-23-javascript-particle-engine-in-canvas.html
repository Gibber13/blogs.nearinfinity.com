<p>The most popular entry I've written at Near Infinity has been the <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/jharwig?entry=javascript_particle_engine">JavaScript Particle Engine</a>.  It had limitations because I used transparent images and only made one color -- black. I recreated the fire demo for a talk -- Advanced Web Graphics with Canvas -- that I gave at the <a href="http://therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/jason_harwig.html">Rich Web Experience</a>. I'll post the slides, sample code, and some more demos in upcoming entries.</p>
 
<p>
The code only took an hour to port from images to canvas, and had a number of benefits:
</p><ul>
<li>Lots more particles can be drawn (20 before, 150 now)</li>
<li>Multiple colors for more realistic modeling</li>
</ul>

<p>
As with all these prototypes I don't spend time porting to IE, but it would work. It would be slower and vml doesn't draw radial gradients correctly so it wouldn't look as good.
