            <p>We have the droids you're looking for! <br /></p><p>NIC-U is happy to announce that
we will be hosting two Android Development Bootcamps classes this
winter. These courses will be held January 10-14 and February 28-March
4 at the the NIC-U Training Center.</p>

<p>The Androidâ„¢ platform is a world-wide phenomenon. Thousands of new
apps are being published in Android Market every week. Take advantage
of this new and exclting smartphone platform by learning how to create
Android applications at one of our Android Development Bootcamps!</p>

<p>These classes will immerse students in the Android platform. Through a
combination of lecture instruction and hands-on labs, attendees will
come away from the class ready to begin writing sophisticated Android
applications.</p>

<p>Both bootcamps will be taught by Mark Murphy, founder of
<a href="http://commonsware.com/" target="_blank">CommonsWare</a>, and the author of<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Android-2-Mark-Murphy/dp/1430226293" target="_blank"> Beginning

development. A polished speaker and trainer, Mr. Murphy has delivered conference
presentations and training sessions on a wide array of topics
internationally.</p>
