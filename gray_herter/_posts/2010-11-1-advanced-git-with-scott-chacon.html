Our friends at Jumpstart Lab will be holding an <a href="http://jumpstartlab.com/trainings/3-git-reston-va">Advanced Git</a> class December 4th, taught by GitHub's <a href="http://scottchacon.com/">Scott Chacon</a>, at the new NIC-U Training Center.<br /><div id=":42">
<br />
The Git source control system is quickly taking over the development world, replacing SVN and CVS. It's strengths lie in fast, distributed control of source code for teams from one to thousands. The real power of Git comes when you move beyond simply "doing what you used to do in SVN, just with Git." It's more than just commits and clones. In this advanced session you'll explore topics like:<br />
<br /><ul><li>
 Managing and merging multiple branches</li><li>
 Workflow best practices (rebasing, merging, etc)</li><li>
 Finding issues with bisect and blame</li><li>
 Hooks</li><li>
 Submodules</li><li>
 Customizing</li></ul>
<br />
This class will be taught by Scott Chacon, chief Git evangelist at <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>, creator of <a href="http://gitcasts.com/">GitCasts</a>, and author of <a href="http://progit.org/book/">Pro Git (Apress) </a>and <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/git-internals-pdf">Git Internals (Peepcode)</a>. Don't miss this chance to learn Git from a true expert.<br />
