<p>Near Infinity is proud to host a new class, "Rails in Production: How to Deploy, Secure, Tune, and Monitor Your Production Rails Application", taught by CodeSherpas' Dave Bock. This class will be held on March 11th at the NIC Training Center.<br /></p>You've build the killer rails app. Now what? This class will go over 
detailed examples from choosing a hosting provider, through provisioning
 and securing your servers, to deploying your app, as well as monitoring
 and tuning performance once in production. In this class, we will 
publish a real website from scratch, with consideration for real world 
concerns, like safeguarding passwords, turning on and off application 
monitoring, multiple machine deployments, and general system 
administration tasks.<br /><br />This class is for anyone responsible for deploying live Rails applications. You should be 
comfortable enough with Rails to generate an app, deal with models and 
migrations, understand layouts and partials. You'll also need the 
ability to navigate around a command line.<br /><br />The instructor, David Bock, has been deploying high-availability, heavily trafficked 
Rails apps for four years and has amassed some great experience in 
dealing with different configurations, traffic patterns and optimization
 techniques. <br /><br />To learn more and to register please visit CodeSherpas' <a href="http://codesherpas.com/training" target="_blank">Rails in Production</a> web site.<br /><br />Be sure to check out our <a href="../../trainingcenter/coursecatalog/upcoming/">Upcoming NIC-U Training Courses</a> page for future courses coming up this spring.
