<p>With all the tools available today for publishing a website or blog,
it's easy to discount the traditional static website. However, you
should think twice before drawing that conclusion. Static websites are
super-fast, easy to implement, and can be hosted with almost any
provider. This short presentation touches on static website generation
using nanoc, a static website generation tool written in Ruby. While
you won't be a nanoc expert after watching the video, it should give
you an idea of how easy it is to quickly get up and running with a
static site.</p>
