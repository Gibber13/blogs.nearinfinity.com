<p>Near Infinity this year adopted 138 children, seniors, and adults through Reston Interfaith's Gifts For Kids drive, a program which helps neighbors in need by providing families with personalized holiday gifts. This is the fifth year Near Infinity has participated in the program, bringing the total number of people who have been adopted by NIC to 322. The company's employees select children from a list showing their age and three wishes, and for each child adopted, the company matches by adopting an additional child.</p>

<p>This year's drive was an overwhelming success for Reston Interfaith, with more than 1,300 children, seniors and adults being paired with donors.</p>
