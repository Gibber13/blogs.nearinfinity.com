you have a ton of data and are trying to figure out what to do with it.
&nbsp;Big data is the newest industry buzzword and there are a myriad of
solutions out there that claim to solve the big data problem. &nbsp;One of
the industry leading technologies at the moment is Hadoop. &nbsp;But what is
Hadoop and how does it make working with big data manageable? &nbsp;Lets see
if we can take some of the essentials of Hadoop and explain them in
more business terms. While no analogy is perfect, I think that this one
is pretty good.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Coca
Cola started in Atlanta Georgia. &nbsp;Coke products were all made in one
plant and distributed locally in Georgia. &nbsp;As the popularity of Coke
increased over the years, the Coca Cola Company had to change the
production and distribution of it's product in order to meet global
demand. &nbsp;Now there are bottling plants all over the world that use raw
materials and Coke recipes to produce and distribute billions of
servings of Coke products a year. &nbsp;As your data grows like the demand
for Coke, one plant will not be enough to satisfy your data production
needs. &nbsp;Enter Hadoop.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Hadoop
is a distributed data crunching architecture very much like Coke's
bottling and distribution network. &nbsp;So, why is it impractical to just
scale one bottling plant as demand grows? Let's see. &nbsp;Physical
infrastructure becomes a problem. &nbsp;As production scales up, you need
more raw material. &nbsp;This means a larger loading dock, more trucks, and
larger roads to accommodate increased traffic. &nbsp;You also need more
machinery, more power, and more people to run the plant. &nbsp;Of course all of
this can scale to a point but could you imagine the infrastructure that
Coca Cola would need in Atlanta to produce all of the billions of cans of Coke that they sell a
year?</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">You
also need a delivery network that delivers product in a timely manner.
This is more problematic. &nbsp;Delivering Coke to new markets that are
further away from the plant means more trucks and aged product. &nbsp;For
all of these reasons Coca Cola made a transformational decision to ship
raw material all over the country and eventually world and have
regional plants bottle Coke locally. &nbsp;You can do the same thing with
data.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Instead
of having one large plant that has a finite production capability,
Hadoop allows you to have thousands of smaller distributed plants that
work together in a network of data production. &nbsp;This solves many big
data problems in the same way that Coke solved their production
problem. &nbsp;A Hadoop cluster of computers is made up of as many
production plants as you need to process your data. Your raw material
is your data. &nbsp;Hadoop automatically distributes this raw material to
all of your data production plants or nodes. &nbsp;When you run a Hadoop
job, instead of pulling data to the program, it pushes the program to
the data just like a recipe would be distributed to all of the bottling
plants that produce Coke. &nbsp;This approach has many benefits over large
singular databases or having one huge bottling plant.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><h5 style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Increase capacity without affecting production</span></h5><p style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Adding
a new plant has no impact on the other plants in the network. &nbsp;When a
new plant comes online, the Hadoop system automatically distributes raw
material to it and sends it data crunching recipes so that it can
immediately increase capacity.</span></p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><h5 style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Upgrade individual plants without halting production </span></h5><p style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">If
there is a new conveyor belt that can increase the capacity of a plant,
while one plant is being upgraded the rest can increase production
slightly in order to absorb the temporarily reduced capacity. &nbsp;</span></p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><h5 style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Absorb plant failures</span></h5><p style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">With
one large system, if something catastrophic happens, all production
stops. &nbsp;With a bottling plant network, if a plant in Wisconsin has to
halt production because of local flooding, the plants in Illinois and
Ohio can ratchet up capacity temporarily to meet demand while flood
waters subside.</span></p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><h5 style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">And then there's scalability</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span></h5><p style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">If
I have one big plant that that is at capacity, what do I do? &nbsp;Do I
build another big plant and double my capacity even though I may
initially only need to increase production by 5%? &nbsp;Since the plants are
smaller, Hadoop allows you to add what you need when you need it.</span></p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"></span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">There
is much more to Hadoop than described here, but I think that this gives
you a good idea as to why you should take a look at it if you have big
data that you want to exploit in some way. &nbsp;This distribution and
production technique did wonders for Coca Cola, just think of what it
could do for you.</span>
