</b><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: normal"> The domain model
contains the idea of a document, and one of the documents in the
model has multiple purposes. By purpose, I mean that the physical
document is filled out with different data depending on who the
document is for. Each purpose may or may not have different logic
associated with the creation. The document abstractions should be
easily testable to make document creation as robust as possible.</span></font></font></p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt"><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: normal">	</span></font><font size="3"><b>A
Solution: </b></font><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: normal">One
solution that I found was based on the template method from the GoF
book. The intent of this solution was to simplify the creation of the
known views of the document. The key idea of the solution is to put
as much of the logic involved in document creation into to the base
class. </span></font></font>

<pre class="prettyprint">abstract class Document
{
	IDictionary<string, string=""> FormTextFields
	{
		get
		{
			return new Dictionary<string, string="">
			{
				{ "NameField", this.NameField },
				{ "AgeField", this.AgeField }
			};
		}
	}
	
	private string NameField
	{
		get
		{
			if(this.DocumentType == DocumentType.Big)
			{
				return "Big name";
			}
			else if(this.DocumentType == DocumentType.Small)
			{
				return "Small name";
			}
			
			return string.Empty;
		}
	}
	
	private string AgeField
	{
		get
		{
			if(this.DocumentType == DocumentType.Big)
			{
				return "42";
			}
			
			return string.Empty;

	}
	
	protected abstract DocumentType DocumentType { get; }

<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt"><font size="3"><b>	Benefits:
</b></font><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: normal">As
previously stated, the main purpose of the base class is to simplify
the creation of the subclasses. This solution does just that by
reducing the amount of work needed to create a new subclass. The
subclasses have only two main actions required for creation. The
first action is to define the type of the document which is an
abstract method in the base class. The second action, not shown in the subclass, is the
validation of the specific concrete document type. Just doing these
two actions, as oppose to adding new creation logic, speeds up the
creation of new subclasses.</span></font></font></p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt"><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: normal">	Two
other benefits to this solution are centralization of the logic for
document creation and having reduced unit testing needs for the subclasses.
When the logic of the document creation is centralized into a single
base class, reasoning about the document creation becomes easier. Problems arising from document creation are easier to track down. The
document base class becomes the focal point for the majority of  the
unit tests written for document creation. The focal point reduces the
need to test the subclasses since the vast majority of the behavior
is in the base.</span></font></font></p>
<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 13pt"><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: normal">	</span></font><font size="3"><b>Drawbacks:</b></font><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: normal">
A large drawback of placing all the logic relating to the document
creation in the base is that the rules for creation have to be
completely available. If the rules of the creation of the document
are not known then the base class will be incomplete. When the base
class is incomplete, it has to be reopened every time a new rule is
found. The problem of adding rules leads to the main drawback of the
solution: extensibility. This solution is in no way extensible since
all the logic is congregated in the base class. This drawback does
pose problems, however with a little rejiggering the impact of this
drawback can be minimized. One possible fix, that will reduce the
extensibility problem, but will increase the work to create a
subclass, is to add an abstract method to the base that filters the
dictionary before it is sent out.&nbsp;</span></font></font>
