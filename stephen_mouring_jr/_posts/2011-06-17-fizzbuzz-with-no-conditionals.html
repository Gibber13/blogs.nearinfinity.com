title: FizzBuzz With No Conditionals

A few weeks ago a coworker and I were discussing several things including the merits of the "FizzBuzz" problem as an interview question and whether or not the "no conditionals in your code" movement is reasonable or not. So I decided to take it&nbsp; as a personal challenge to combine those conversations in this blog post and solve "FizzBuzz" without any if statements! <br /><br />(For those unfamiliar with the "FizzBuzz" problem, the goal is to take each number from 1 to 100. If the number is evenly divisible by 3 then the program should print "Fizz" to the console. If it is evenly divisible by 5 then it should print "Buzz". If it is evenly divisible by both then it should print "FizzBuzz". If none of those conditions are true, the program should print the number itself.)<br /><br /><i>Disclaimer: FizzBuzz apparently has a huge following on the internet and people have posted literally hundreds of solutions to this simple problem so I apologize in advance if someone else has already posted this code. For the record, I wrote it in isolation!<br /></i><br />For reference, the most common solution to FizzBuzz is something like this:<br /><br />

{% highlight javascript %}
public class FizzBuzz {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 100; ++i) {
      if (i%3 == 0) {
        System.out.print("Fizz");
	  }
	  if (i%5 == 0) {
	    System.out.print("Buzz");
      }
      if (i%3 != 0 && i%5 != 0) {
        System.out.print(i);
      }
      System.out.println("");
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}<br /><br />

So here is my "unconditionally no conditionals" solution:<br /><br />

{% highlight javascript %}
public class FizzBuzz {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String[][] fizzbuzz = new String[][] {
      new String[] {"FizzBuzz", "Fizz"},
      new String[] {"Buzz", ""},
  };


  int n = 100;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    fizzbuzz[1][1] = ""+i;
    int f = (int)Math.ceil((i % 3) / (double)n);
    int b = (int)Math.ceil((i % 5) / (double)n);
    System.out.println(i + ": " + fizzbuzz[f][b]);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
