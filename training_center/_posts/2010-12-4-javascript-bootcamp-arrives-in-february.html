<p>Near Infinity is proud to announce that Chris Williams will debut his
new JavaScript Bootcamp classes right here at the Near Infinity
Training Center, February 10-11, 2011. The JS Bootcamp promises to
take developers from being interested in JavaScript to proficiency in
just two days.</p>

<p>JS is the scripting language that powers the web and increasingly it
is becoming critical for many tasks outside of the browser.
Unfortunately, many people, possibly you, are not yet proficient in
this highly usable and very important programming language. Maybe you
have dabbled with a JS library like jQuery or Prototype, but you now
want to understand what is going on and why. Perhaps you program
Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl or another language and making your
application rich and interactive on the web has you befuddled. Perhaps
you are program manager and you want your design and development teams
to communicate better with one another Whatever the reason, now is the
perfect time to learn JS properly and this is the class for you.</p>

<p>The JS Bootcamp will be taught by Chris Williams, the originator the
popular JSConf JavaScript conference, the first real JavaScript
conference. Chris is also the producer of <a href="http://www.aminutewithbrendan.com/" target="_blank">A Minute With Brendan</a> and <a href="http://jsconflive.com/" target="_blank">JSConfLive</a></p>
