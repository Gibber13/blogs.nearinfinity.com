 Near Infinity is proud to host a new class, "Rails in Production: How to Deploy, Secure, Tune, and Monitor Your Production Rails Application", taught by CodeSherpas' Dave Bock. This class will be held on Friday June 10 at the NIC Training Center.

You've build the killer rails app. Now what? This class will go over detailed examples from choosing a hosting provider, through provisioning and securing your servers, to deploying your app, as well as monitoring and tuning performance once in production. In this class, we will publish a real website from scratch, with consideration for real world concerns, like safeguarding passwords, turning on and off application monitoring, multiple machine deployments, and general system administration tasks.

This class is for anyone responsible for deploying live Rails applications. You should be comfortable enough with Rails to generate an app, deal with models and migrations, understand layouts and partials. You'll also need the ability to navigate around a command line.

The instructor, David Bock, has been deploying high-availability, heavily trafficked Rails apps for four years and has amassed some great experience in dealing with different configurations, traffic patterns and optimization techniques.
