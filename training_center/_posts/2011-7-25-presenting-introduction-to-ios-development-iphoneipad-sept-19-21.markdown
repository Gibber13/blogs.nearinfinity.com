Near Infinity is proud to announce our first home-grown public class offering, Introduction to iOS development (iPhone/iPad)! This class will be taught by Chris D'Agostino. Chris has been teaching this class at George Mason and in various private offerings to our customers for a while. Now it is ready for prime time! 
During the three day Introduction to iOS development (iPhone/iPad) class students will learn the fundamentals of building iPhone applications through a combination of lecture and hands-on labs. Each lab will build on the previous lab to demonstrate a range of capabilities for the iOS platform.
