<p>Edit 2008-04-29: more and better results available <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/seths?entry=projecteuler_problem_1_in_c">here</a>.
</p><p>I've been waffling about glancing at Python. It comes off as a little ... dry? Indentation drives scope? I was afraid it would be another Objective-C; popular, modeled after successful languages, but just gets stuck in my mental parser. Even Visual Basic and Pascal (q.v. <i>Inside Macintosh</i>) passed that gate.

</p><p>Anyways, <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> seemed like a good way to learn a new language. Problem #1 is summing multiples of 3 or 5 less than one thousand. Some basic iteration handles the task pretty easily -- might as well be all trendy and mix in lambda functions. And, while the hood is open, why not try it in a couple of languages and generate an unscientific performance graph?

</p><p>So back to the implementation -- the iterative approach is easy. But Python 2.5-ish natively supports set operations like union and intersection. Combine that with a built-in method to generate numeric sequences and the problem is basically solved. For the win -- it outperformed the iterative approach! Oh, and every language tested except Python showed negative numbers when the sum scrolled past 2**31.

</p><p>Groovy, Python, C, and Emacs Lisp competed for best performance. And by competed, I mean quick and dirty code (esp. Lisp) run a few times on my MacBook Pro. Graphics first, then the code.

<p>Python, iterative
</p><pre class="prettyprint">import sys

def multiple_checker(val):
    return lambda test: test and val and test % val == 0

mof3 = multiple_checker(3)
mof5 = multiple_checker(5)
sum = 0

for i in range(10 ** int(sys.argv[1])):
    if mof3(i) or mof5(i):
        sum = sum + i

print sum
</pre>
<hr>
Python, set oriented
<pre class="prettyprint">import sys

exp = int(sys.argv[1])
sum = 0

for mof3or5 in set(range(3, 10**exp, 3)) | set(range(5, 10**exp, 5)):
    sum = sum + mof3or5

print sum
</pre>
<hr>
Groovy, iterative
<pre class="prettyprint">exp = Integer.parseInt(args[0])

mof = { val, test -&gt; val &amp;&amp; test &amp;&amp; test % val == 0 }
mof3 = mof.curry(3)
mof5 = mof.curry(5)

sum = 0 as BigDecimal

(3..&lt;(10**exp)).each {
    if (mof3(it) || mof5(it)) {
        sum += it
    }
}

println sum
</pre>
<hr>
Emacs Lisp, iterative (be nice, I'm really weak here)
<pre class="prettyprint">(defun multiple_of (a b)
  (= 0 (% a b))
)

(defun val-to-add (val)
  (cond
   ((multiple_of val 3) val)
   ((multiple_of val 5) val)
   (0)
   )
  )

(defun sum-of-3or5-multiples (exp)
  (let ((num 3) (sum 0.0))
    (while (&lt; num (expt 10 exp))
      (setq sum (+ sum (val-to-add num)))
      (setq num (1+ num))
      )
    sum
    )
  )
</pre>
<hr>
C, iterative. Not very much code here, would have probably taken more lines of Java!
<pre class="prettyprint">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

#define multiple_of(a, b) ((a == 0 || b == 0) ? 0 : a % b == 0)

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    int exp = atoi(argv[1]);
    double sum = 0;
    int i;

    for (i = 3; i &lt; pow(10, exp); i++)
        if (multiple_of(i, 3) || multiple_of(i, 5))
            sum += i;

    printf("%0.0f\n", sum);

    return 0;
}
</pre>
