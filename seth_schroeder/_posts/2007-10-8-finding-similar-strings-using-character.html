title: Finding similar strings using character level bigrams

<p>Earlier I <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/seths?entry=counting_beignets_soundex_levenshtein_or">looked at</a> soundex as a more robust way of comparing strings. Soundex was more robust than case &amp; space normalizing... but it missed somethings I wanted and found some things I didn't want. Here's an example based on a rather limited wine rack:
</p><pre class="prettyprint">CREATE TABLE winerack (
      wine_type TEXT
    , ready DATE
    , soundex_val TEXT
);

INSERT INTO winerack (wine_type, ready, soundex_val)
    VALUES ('cabernet sauvingon', now() + interval '5 years', 'C165');

INSERT INTO winerack (wine_type, ready, soundex_val)
    VALUES ('cabermet sauvingon', now() + interval '6 years', 'C165');

INSERT INTO winerack (wine_type, ready, soundex_val)
    VALUES ('caberet sauvingon', now() + interval '7 years', 'C163');

INSERT INTO winerack (wine_type, ready, soundex_val)
    VALUES ('cabernet franc', now() + interval '8 years', 'C165');
</pre>

<p>Now I'd like to find all of the Cabernets Sauvignon. Using a literal match one bottle shows up. Three bottles show up using soundex... but not the right three bottles:
</p><pre class="prettyprint">bigrams=# SELECT * FROM winerack WHERE soundex_val = 'C165';
     wine_type      |   ready    | soundex_val 
--------------------+------------+-------------
 cabernet sauvingon | 2012-10-08 | C165
 cabermet sauvingon | 2013-10-08 | C165
 cabernet franc     | 2015-10-08 | C165
(3 rows)
</pre>
<p>What happened? Well, soundex picked up the "cabermet" which was good. But it also picked up the Cabernet Franc which was bad. Also, it missed the "cabaret sauvingon".
</p><p>Cabernet Franc was picked up because a soundex value contains at most four consonants. 'C', 'b', 'r', 'n' in this case. Nothing else matters afterwards... shudder to imagine "cabernet sausage" showing up in the search results!
</p><p>Caberet Sauvignon was ignored because soundex doesn't compare strings. It's almost like a really primitive string hashing function. String in, string out. Easy to use though.
</p><p>I approached <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/rdonaway">Rob</a> with this and he suggested I give character-level bigrams a try. Basically this finds how similar words are based on how often pairs of characters occur. Rob is being very patient with me as I work through the gory details, but this is my general understanding:
</p><pre class="prettyprint">similarity(left_str, right_str)
    left_sum = dot_product(left_str, left_str);
    right_sum = dot_product(right_str, right_str);
    pair_sum = dot_product(left_str, right_str);
    return pair_sum / square_root(left_sum * right_sum);
</pre>

<p>The moment of truth -- did it outperform soundex?

</p><pre class="prettyprint">bigrams=# select * from bigram_similarities;
      term_a       |      term_b       |    similarity     
-------------------+-------------------+-------------------
 cabernetsauvignon | cabernetsauvignon |                 1
 cabernetsauvignon | cabermetsauvignon |             0.875
 cabernetsauvignon | caberetsauvignon  | 0.903696114115064
 cabernetsauvignon | cabernetfranc     | 0.505181485540923
</pre>

<p>In this contrived case it worked out better. No clue further than that. It is easy to use like soundex:
</p><pre class="prettyprint">bigrams=# select bigram_similarity('cabernet sauvignon', 'cabernet franc');
 bigram_similarity 
-------------------
 0.505181485540923
</pre>
<p>The infrastructure behind this is pretty gory. The code's not really polished and I have some concerns about performance. But here's a really neat way to generate a dot product using SQL:

</p><pre class="prettyprint">CREATE TABLE bigrams ( term TEXT, bigram CHAR(2), instances INT );

SELECT
    SUM(lhs.instances * rhs.instances) AS dot_product
FROM
    bigrams lhs, bigrams rhs
WHERE
    lhs.bigram = rhs.bigram
        AND
    lhs.term = 'cabernet sauvignon'
        AND
    rhs.term = 'cabernet franc'
</pre>
