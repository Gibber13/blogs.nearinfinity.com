<p>Edit 2008-04-29: more and better results available <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/seths?entry=projecteuler_problem_1_in_c">here</a>.
</p><p>I've been waffling about glancing at Python. It comes off as a little ... dry? Indentation drives scope? I was afraid it would be another Objective-C; popular, modeled after successful languages, but just gets stuck in my mental parser. Even Visual Basic and Pascal (q.v. <i>Inside Macintosh</i>) passed that gate.

</p><p>Anyways, <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> seemed like a good way to learn a new language. Problem #1 is summing multiples of 3 or 5 less than one thousand. Some basic iteration handles the task pretty easily -- might as well be all trendy and mix in lambda functions. And, while the hood is open, why not try it in a couple of languages and generate an unscientific performance graph?

</p><p>So back to the implementation -- the iterative approach is easy. But Python 2.5-ish natively supports set operations like union and intersection. Combine that with a built-in method to generate numeric sequences and the problem is basically solved. For the win -- it outperformed the iterative approach! Oh, and every language tested except Python showed negative numbers when the sum scrolled past 2**31.

</p><p>Groovy, Python, C, and Emacs Lisp competed for best performance. And by competed, I mean quick and dirty code (esp. Lisp) run a few times on my MacBook Pro. Graphics first, then the code.
