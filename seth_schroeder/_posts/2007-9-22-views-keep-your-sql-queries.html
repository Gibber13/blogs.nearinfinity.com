title: Views keep your SQL queries DRY

<p>A SQL view is a SELECT statement stored in the database which can be used like a table. So... what? Well, some of the benefits include:
</p><p>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Syntax verified before deployment -- avoids errors from queries built at runtime.
    </li><li>The RDBMS knows to expect it and could prepare an execution plan.
    </li><li>Force users to use a view which excludes sensitive table data.
    </li><li>Centralize important, common logic.
  </li></ol>
  
  Number 4 is the strongest argument. It is the Don't Repeat Yourself argument for data. Duplicate code <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html">stinks</a>! The fix is defining and calling <cite>"a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"</cite> (<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/extracts/rule_list.html">src</a>). So why not treat data that well? Here's a silly example (in PostgreSQLish):
<p>

</p><pre class="prettyprint">CREATE TABLE pantry (food TEXT, course TEXT, expiry DATE);
INSERT INTO pantry (food, course, expiry)
    VALUES ('crumpets', 'breakfast', now() + interval '2 weeks');
INSERT INTO pantry (food, course, expiry)
    VALUES ('canned ravioli', 'lunch', now() + interval '2 years');
INSERT INTO pantry (food, course, expiry)
    VALUES ('instant noodles', 'dinner', now() + interval '2 years');
INSERT INTO pantry (food, course, expiry)
    VALUES ('fruitcake', 'snack', now() + interval '2000 years');
</pre>
<p>Imagine these meal planning queries:
</p><ul>
  <li><code class="prettyprint">SELECT food FROM pantry WHERE course = 'breakfast' AND expiry > now();</code>
  </li><li><code class="prettyprint">SELECT food FROM pantry WHERE course = 'lunch' AND expiry > now();</code>
  </li><li><code class="prettyprint">SELECT food FROM pantry WHERE course = 'dinner' AND expiry > now();</code>
  </li><li><code class="prettyprint">SELECT food FROM pantry WHERE course = 'snack' AND expiry > now();</code>
</li></ul>
<p>Well, that's pretty gory. No abstraction at all -- <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/mysterymeatnavigation.html">mystery meat</a> queries which need unnecessary work to be understood. Two things need to be abstracted:  course and expiry. No one wants stale food, so build that logic first:
</p><pre class="prettyprint">CREATE VIEW fresh_food AS
    SELECT *
    FROM pantry
    WHERE expiry &lt; now();
</pre>
<p>Voici! The per-course queries look like: <code class="prettyprint">SELECT food FROM fresh_food where course = 'foo'</code>. But, why stop abstracting now? Why not this?
</p><pre class="prettyprint">CREATE VIEW breakfast_menu AS
    SELECT *
    FROM fresh_food
    WHERE course = 'breakfast';
</pre>
<p>This example is almost too silly, but one more good point can be squeezed out yet. A key benefit of centralized logic is having one place to make bug fixes. For example, the typo in <code class="prettyprint">fresh_food</code> which returns <i>stale</i> food. Fix the view DML and all client code immediately benefits without change.
</p><p>Unfortunately in practice performance can easily suffer when using (and especially layering) views.
