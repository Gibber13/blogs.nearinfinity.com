<a href="http://grails.codehaus.org/">Grails</a> has big hopes. It hopes to find a place for <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a> in every tier of a Java-based webapp. It hopes to vanquish configuration files by enforcing implicit requirements / conventions. It hopes to simplify starting a respectable Java webapp by providing and configuring Hibernate, Spring, and multi-environment build files.

<p>I hope the Grails dev team succeeds. JRuby is a well-intentioned, <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/09/12/068253">well-heeled</a>, but misbegotten creation (q.v. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Frankenstein">V. Frankenstein</a>). Should Groovy succeed, it should be the ultimate Java webapp framework. Ultimate in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=define:ultimate">this</a> sense: "being the last or concluding element of a series." Consider this diagram of a minimal Grails application -- can you find room for more layers?</p>

<p><b>All</b> of those jar files are in the classpath and configured for immediate coding. Did I mention the grails commandline app? It's fantastic. It creates classes &amp; test classes, runs tests, runs apps, and is a good engine for the development workflow.

So what's the catch? Adding Grails into an existing project doesn't make much sense. The Grails skeleton would duplicate much of the existing infrastructure. Migrating existing code into a Grails skeleton can be done, but some refactoring will be needed. Here's my quick take based on some tinkering.

<h3>Controllers</h3>Rewrite controllers. A controller in Grails lives for one request, unlike a long-lived Spring MVC controller. Grails has done a good job of improving the process of implementing a controller: autobinding the query string key:value pairs to instance fields, simple url mapping conventions, and more.

<h3>Services</h3>Consider migrating .java business logic to Grails .groovy services. A Grails service class instance is long lived as in Spring MVC; it can also be injected into a Grails controller very easily. Java service classes with complicated transaction requirements should not be migrated. Transaction / rollback is applied to all Grails service methods by default. Disabling rollback affects all methods in a service class.

<h3>Views and layouts</h3>Grails supports Groovy Server Pages (.gsp) and Java Server Pages (.jsp); Sitemesh can be used with both. Unfortunately support for custom JSP tag libraries will wait until version 0.6. GSP isn't bad. The conditional control flow tags are nice, but I really see no strong reason to prefer a .gsp to a .jsp. One notable item on the roadmap is support for Spring Web Flow.

<h3>Model / DAO / domain classes</h3>Hibernate mapping files and annotations are well understood ways to control ORM. GORM configuration uses static class variables. Here is a partial list: <code class="prettyprint">optionals, transients, belongsTo, hasMany, mappedBy, embedded, constraints</code>. Grails supports Groovy SQL but has plans to fork it eventually. GORM also injects id and version properties to domain objects at runtime. 

<h3>Conclusion</h3>Grails adds layers, but more cake-like than onion-like. Programmers can look forward to writing Groovy code for a multi-tier webapp with the dependencies already in place. Much existing code can be migrated in by adapting it to the Grails conventions; other parts may be included as .java files. The largest learning curve will probably be GORM. Finally, it's probably a good idea to let Grails mature for 3-6 months before deploying it into production.
