<p>On my current (Java-based) project we now write all new unit tests in Groovy, though there are a lot of legacy Java tests still out there that we haven't had time or felt the need to convert to Groovy-based tests. There are also several base test classes, also written in Java, that provide some nice set up and tear down code for certain classes of test. I happened to be testing a web controller and realized I needed (or rather, wanted) to make use of the existing <code>AbstractViewControllerTest</code> base class, which is written in Java, uses JUnit4 annotations, and provides, among other things, code that creates and sets up a simulated authenticated user for the controller along with a bunch of other stuff like mock requests, responses, session, helper methods, etc. So, the problem was that I needed to extend <code>AbstractViewControllerTest</code> and not <code>GroovyTestCase</code>, and initially got all bent out of shape about having to choose to write the test in Java and extend the base test or write it in Groovy extending <code>GroovyTestCase</code> and having to redo the stuff already provided by the base class.</p>

<p>Thankfully about that time <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/sfarley">Steve</a> reminded me nicely that you can mix-and-match Groovy and JUnit4 annotations just fine since Groovy has now sported annotation support for a while now (since ~1.1 I think). So I can simply write the test in Groovy, extend the base test class, and use JUnit4 annotations to get exactly what I want. What's the point? Just remember that when writing tests in Groovy there is nothing that says you <i>must</i> extend <code>GroovyTestCase</code> and that you can use JUnit4 in Groovy tests. So for example you could have a Groovy test like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">class MyTest extends TestBaseClass {
    @Before
    void doSetup() { ... }
	
    @Test
    void testSomething() { ... }
	
    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException)
    void testBadThing() { ... }
}
</pre>

<p>This way you can extend some other class if you choose, and get all the normal JUnit4 stuff. Since you are not extending <code>GroovyTestCase</code> one thing that is missing is <code>shouldFail()</code> so instead you use the "expected" parameter in your <code>@Test</code> annotation when you want to verify a specific type of exception was thrown.</p>
