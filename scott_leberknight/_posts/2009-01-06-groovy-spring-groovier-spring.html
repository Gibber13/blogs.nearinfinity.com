<p>If you're into Groovy and Spring, check out my <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=groovier+spring">two-part</a> series on <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/">IBM developerWorks</a> on using Groovy together with Spring's dynamic language support for potentially more flexible (and interesting) applications. In <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-groovierspring1.html">Part 1</a> I show how to easily integrate Groovy <i>scripts</i> (i.e. .groovy files containing one or more classes) into Spring-based applications. In <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-groovierspring2.html">Part 2</a> I show how to use the "refreshable beans" feature in Spring to automatically and transparently reload Spring beans implemented in Groovy from pretty much anywhere including a relational database, and why you might actually are to do something like that!</p>
