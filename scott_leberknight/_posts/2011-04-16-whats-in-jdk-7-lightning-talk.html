 <p>Yesterday at the <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com">Near Infinity</a> 2011 Spring Conference I gave a talk on CoffeeScript (see <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/scott_leberknight/coffeescript_slides.html"> here</a>) and a very short lightning talk on what exactly is in JDK 7. You can find the slides for the JDK 7 talk <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/scottleber/wtf-is-in-javajdkwtf7">here</a> if you're interested.</p>
