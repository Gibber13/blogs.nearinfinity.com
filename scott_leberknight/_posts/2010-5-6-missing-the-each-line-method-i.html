title: Missing the each_line method in FakeFS version 0.2.1? Add it!

<p>Recently we have been using the excellent <a href="http://github.com/defunkt/fakefs">FakeFS</a> (fake filesystem) gem in some specs to test code that reads and writes files on the filesystem. We are using the latest <em>release</em> version of this gem which is 0.2.1 as I am writing this. Some of the code under test uses the <code>IO</code> <code>each_line</code> method to iterate lines in relatively largish files. But we found out quickly that is a problem, since in version 0.2.1 the <code>FakeFS::File</code> class does not extend <code>StringIO</code> and so you don't get all its methods such as <code>each_line</code>. (The <a href="http://github.com/defunkt/fakefs/blob/master/lib/fakefs/file.rb">version on master in GitHub</a> as I write this does extend <code>StringIO</code>, but it is not yet released as a formal version.)

As an example suppose we have the following code that prints out the size of each line in a file as stars (asterisks):

<pre class="prettyprint">
def lines_to_stars(file_path)
  File.open(file_path, 'r').each_line { |line| puts '*' * line.size }
end
</pre>

<p>Let's say we use FakeFS to create a fake file like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
require 'fakefs/safe'
require 'stringio'

FakeFS.activate!

File.open('/tmp/foo.txt', 'w') do |f|
  f.write "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\n"
  f.write "The quick red fox jumped over the sleepy cat\n"
  f.write "Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack jumped over the candle stick\n"
  f.write "Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are\n"
  f.write "The End."
end
</pre>

<p>So far, so good. But now if we call <code>lines_to_stars</code> we get an error:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
NoMethodError: undefined method `each_line' for #&lt;FakeFS::File:0x000001012c22b8&gt;
</pre>

<p>Oops. No <code>each_line</code>. If you don't want to use an unreleased version of the gem, you can add <code>each_line</code> onto FakeFS::File using the following code:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
module FakeFS
  class File
    def each_line
      File.readlines(self.path).each { |line| yield line }
    end
  end
end
</pre>

<p>Basically all it does is define <code>each_line</code> so that it reads all the lines from a (fake) file on the (fake) filesystem and then yields them up one by one, so you can have code under test that iterates a file and work as expected. So now calling <code>lines_to_stars</code> gives a nice pretty bar chart containing the line sizes represented by stars:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
********************************************
********************************************
***************************************************************
*******************************************************
********
</pre>

<p>Since we're using RSpec, to make this work nicely we added the above code that defines <code>each_line</code> into a file named <code>fakefs.rb</code> in the <code>spec/support</code> directory, since <code>spec_helper</code> requires supporting files in the <code>spec/support</code> directory and its subdirectories. So now all our specs automatically get the <code>each_line</code> behavior when using FakeFS.</p>
