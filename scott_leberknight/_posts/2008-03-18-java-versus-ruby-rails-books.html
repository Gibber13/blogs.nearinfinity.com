<p>Remember when the big joke was to compare the book stacks of a typical Java web developer with that of a Ruby/Rails developer?</p>

<p>I suppose it was only a matter of time, because now maybe the Ruby/Rails stack looks more like this:</p>

<p>By the way, I like and use Ruby/Rails and use Java among other languages like Python and Groovy so I am not  comparing the actual technologies, just the <i>available reading material</i>. The real trend is that since the original Java vs. Ruby books stack images first appeared, Ruby/Rails have gained a lot of traction and people are naturally writing a lot more material to satisfy the demand. I should also note that shawn <a href="http://garbett.org/articles/2007/06/09/ruby-java-book-stacks">believes</a> that you still only need the original two Pragmatic Programmer books <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3">Programming Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails2">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>. Regardless, there are a lot more options available now and I've heard people say books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Way-Second-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0672328844">The Ruby Way</a> and <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_rr">Rails Recipes</a> are very good books as well. Ah the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/0060005688">paradox of choice</a>.</p>
