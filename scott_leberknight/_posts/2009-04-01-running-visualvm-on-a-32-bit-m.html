<p>If you want/need to run <a href="https://visualvm.dev.java.net/">VisualVM</a> on a <i>32-bit</i> Macbook Pro you'll need to do a couple of things. First, download and install Soy Latte, using <a href="http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/static/soylatte/">these instructions</a> - this gets you a Java 6 JDK/JRE on your 32-bit Macbook Pro. Second, download VisualVM and extract it wherever, e.g. /usr/local/visualvm. If you now try to run VisualVM you'll get the following error message:</p>

{% highlight text %}
$ ./visualvm
./..//platform9/lib/nbexec: line 489: /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home/bin/java: Bad CPU type in executable
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Oops. After looking at the bin/visualvm script I noticed it is looking for an environment variable named "jdkhome." So the third step is to export an environment variable named 'jdkhome' that points to wherever you installed Soy Latte:

{% highlight text %}
export jdkhome=/usr/local/soylatte16-i386-1.0.3
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now run the bin/visualvm script from the command line. Oh, almost forgot to mention that you should also have <a href="http://developer.apple.com/opensource/tools/X11.html">X11</a> installed, which it will be by default on Mac OS X Leopard. Now if all went well, you should have VisualVM up and running!</p>
