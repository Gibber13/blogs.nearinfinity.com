title: Using Keynote Remote When There's No Wi-Fi Around

 <p>I just bought <a href="http://appadvice.com/appnn/2009/01/review-keynote-remote/">Keynote Remote</a> for my iPhone. It is very simple, has the option to display presenter notes, and is absurdly simple to link to Keynote and start controlling presentations. What was a little more involved was that I wanted to use it regardless of whether there is a wireless network around or not. Since Keynote Remote requires a wi-fi connection here's what I'm doing to get around this little annoyance. Basically all you need to do is set up an ad-hoc wireless network with your Mac, and have your iPhone connect to that network. Voila! So, when there's no wireless network available, I just use my handy-dandy Verizon Wireless USB760 Modem to connect to the Internet, and I can still control presentations with Keynote Remote.</p>
