title: Database-Backed Refreshable Beans with Groovy and Spring 3

<p>In 2009 I published a <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=groovier+spring">two-part</a> series of articles on IBM developerWorks entitled <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-groovierspring1.html">Groovier</a> <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-groovierspring2.html">Spring</a>. The articles showed how Spring supports implementing beans in Groovy whose behavior can be changed at runtime via the "refreshable beans" feature. This feature essentially detects when a Spring bean backed by a Groovy script has changed, recompiles it, and replaces the old bean with the new one. This feature is pretty powerful in certain scenarios, for example in PDF generation; mail or any kind of template generation; and as a way to implement runtime modifiable business rules. One specific use case I showed was how to implement PDF generation where the Groovy scripts reside in a database, allowing you to change how PDFs are generated by simply updating Groovy scripts in your database.</p>

<p>In order to load Groovy scripts from a database, I showed how to implement custom <code>ScriptFactoryPostProcessor</code> and <code>ScriptSource</code> classes. The <code>CustomScriptFactoryPostProcessor</code> extends the default Spring <code>ScriptFactoryPostProcessor</code> and overrides the <code>convertToScriptSource</code> method to recognize a database-based script, e.g. you could specify a script source of <code>database:com/nearinfinity/demo/GroovyPdfGenerator.groovy</code>. There is also <code>DatabaseScriptSource</code> that implements the <code>ScriptSource</code> interface and which knows how to load Groovy scripts from a database.</p>

<p>In order to put these pieces together, you need to do a bit of configuration. In the articles I used Spring 2.5.x which was <i>current at the time in early 2009</i>. The configuration looked like this:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<bean id="dataSource"
  class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource">
    <!-- set data source props, e.g. driverClassName, url, username, password... -->
</bean&gt

<bean id="scriptFactoryPostProcessor"
  class="com.nearinfinity.spring.scripting.support.CustomScriptFactoryPostProcessor">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>

<lang:groovy id="pdfGenerator"
  script-source="database:com/nearinfinity/demo/DemoGroovyPdfGenerator.groovy">
    <lang:property name="companyName" value="Database Groovy Bookstore"/>
</lang:groovy>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In Spring 2.5.x this works because the <code><lang:groovy></code> tag looks for a Spring bean with id "scriptFactoryPostProcessor" and if one exists it uses it, if not it creates it. In the above configuration we created our own "scriptFactoryPostProcessor" bean for <code><lang:groovy></code> tags to utilize. So all's well...until you move to Spring 3.x at which point the above configuration no longer works. This was pointed out to me by Jo√£o from Brazil who tried the sample code in the articles with Spring 3.x, and it did not work. After trying a bunch of things, we eventually determined that in Spring 3.x the <code><lang:groovy></code> tag looks for a <code>ScriptFactoryPostProcessor</code> bean whose id is "org.springframework.scripting.config.scriptFactoryPostProcessor" not just "scriptFactoryPostProcessor." So once you figure this out, it is easy to change the above configuration to:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<bean id="org.springframework.scripting.config.scriptFactoryPostProcessor"
  class="com.nearinfinity.spring.scripting.support.CustomScriptFactoryPostProcessor">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>

<lang:groovy id="pdfGenerator"
  script-source="database:com/nearinfinity/demo/DemoGroovyPdfGenerator.groovy">
    <lang:property name="companyName" value="Database Groovy Bookstore"/>
</lang:groovy>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then, everything works as expected and the Groovy scripts can reside in your database and be automatically reloaded when you change them. So if you download the article sample code as-is, it will work since the bundled Spring version is 2.5.4, but if you update to Spring 3.x then you'll need to modify the configuration in applicationContext.xml for example #7 (EX #7) as shown above to change the "scriptFactoryPostProcessor" bean to be "org.springframework.scripting.config.scriptFactoryPostProcessor." Note there is a scheduled JIRA issue <a href="https://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-5106">SPR-5106</a> that will make the <code>ScriptFactoryPostProcessor</code> mechanism pluggable, so that you won't need to extend the default <code>ScriptFactoryPostProcessor</code> and replace the default bean, etc. But until then, this hack continues to work pretty well.</p>
