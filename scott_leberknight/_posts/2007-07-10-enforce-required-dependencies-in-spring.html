title: Enforce Required Dependencies in Spring 2.0

<p>Spring 2.0 added the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/docs/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Required.html">@Required</a> annotation that allows you to define which bean properties are <i>required</i> to be injected. In combination with the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/docs/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html">RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor</a>,  Spring will blow up at application startup if any dependencies are not satisfied. In my (admittedly limited) testing of this feature, only one unsatisfied dependency is reported at a time - in other words Spring fails fast at the first missing dependency. In any case, the following is all you need to do to enable this feature.</p>

<p>First, annotate the setter methods for required properties.</p>

{% highlight java %}
// In some class that requires a UserDao to be injected.
@Required
public void setUserDao(UserDao userDao) {
    this.userDao = userDao;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Second, in one of your Spring application context files, add the following:</p>

{% highlight xml %}
<bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor"/>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>That's it. If you want you can configure the <code>RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor</code> to look for a different type of annotation, for example maybe you want your own <code>@Injected</code> annotation:</p>

{% highlight java %}
// In some class that requires a UserDao to be injected.
@Injected
public void setUserDao(UserDao userDao) {
    this.userDao = userDao;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight xml %}
<bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor">
    <property name="requiredAnnotationType" value="com.acme.annotation.Injected"/>
</bean>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Overall this is a nice feature that might save you some time debugging a missing dependency and at the same time making your code a little more explicit, since the annotated setter methods tell the reader something, i.e. that this is a "special" property that is required to be set before the class can successfully be used.</p>
