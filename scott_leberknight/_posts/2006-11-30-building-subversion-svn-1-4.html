<p>Today I needed to install Subversion on my Macbook running OS X and was following <a href="http://hivelogic.com/about">Dan Benjamin's</a> excellent <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/2006/04/19/svn_on_os_x">instructions</a> for accomplishing this task. The main difference was that I wanted to install the latest and greatest (as of today) version of Subversion, which is 1.4.2. Dan's instructions covered 1.3.1 and a co-worker was able to install SVN just fine using those instructions and the older version. I started following the instructions, substituting 1.4.2 for 1.3.1. Everything was going nicely until the <code>configure</code>, at which point I received an error stating "no suitable apr found". The following is the full output.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">configure: Configuring Subversion 1.4.2

checking for APR... no
configure: WARNING: APR not found
The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library cannot be found.
Please install APR on this system and supply the appropriate
--with-apr option to 'configure'

or

get it with SVN and put it in a subdirectory of this source:

   svn co \
    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/apr/apr/branches/0.9.x \
    apr

Run that right here in the top level of the Subversion tree,
then run autogen.sh again.

Whichever of the above you do, you probably need to do
something similar for apr-util, either providing both
--with-apr and --with-apr-util to 'configure', or
getting both from SVN with:

   svn co \
    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/apr/apr-util/branches/0.9.x \
    apr-util

configure: error: no suitable apr found
</pre>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>I searched around Google a bit to see if anyone else had encountered (and solved) this problem. Didn't find much so I decided to go ahead and follow the suggestion to install Apache Portable Runtime and then try the configuration again. In case you run into the same problem, here are the modified instructions I used to build SVN 1.4.2 for OS X. Thanks to Dan for the original instructions, and I hope the modified ones will help you out too. Admittedly I did not think too much about exactly why I needed <code>apr</code> and was interested in just getting it to work. So if I've done something stupid by installing <code>apr</code> please feel free to post a comment and let me know!</p>

<p>One last note is that the following commands contain my username, <code>sleberkn</code>, so of course you'll need to substitute your username, or follow <a href="http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/page/jharwig">Jason's</a> suggestion to use <code>$HOME</code> instead. Before just trying these commands, first read Dan's entire <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/2006/04/19/svn_on_os_x">post</a> so you have all the prerequisites, such as setting your <code>PATH</code> correctly!</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">cd ~/Desktop

</pre>

<p>Assuming all that worked, verify your installation.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">which svn
svn --version
</pre>

<p>The output from the above commands should show the Subversion is installed in  <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. My output looked like this.</p>
