<p>Last Thursday (on Cinco de Mayo) I gave a presentation on <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> and <a href="http://hive.apache.org/">Hive</a> at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/dc-jug/">Nova/DC Java Users Group</a>. As several people asked about getting the slides, I've shared them <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/scottleber/hadoop-7904044">here</a> on Slideshare. I also posted the presentation sample code on Github at <a href="https://github.com/sleberknight/basic-hadoop-examples">basic-hadoop-examples</a>.</p>
