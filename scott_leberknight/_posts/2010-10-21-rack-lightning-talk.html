<p>I gave a short lightning talk on <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a> tonight at the <a href="http://novarug.org/">NovaRUG</a>. It's on slideshare <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/scottleber/rack-5521616">here</a>. Rack is really cool  because it makes creating modular functionality really easy. For example, if you want to have exceptions mailed to you you can use the Rack::MailExceptions middleware, or if you want responses compressed you can add one line of code to a Rails app to use Rack::Deflater. Cool.</p>
