  <p>I've just published the second article of a two-part series in the December 2009 <a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home/magazine_subscribe?id=10">NFJS Magazine</a> on Hibernate Performance Tuning. Here's the abstract:</p>

<p><em>Tuning performance in Hibernate applications is all about reducing the number of database queries or eliminating them entirely using caching. In the first article in this two part series, you saw how to tune object retrieval using eager fetching techniques to optimize queries and avoid lazy-loads. In this second and final article, I'll show you how inheritance strategy affects performance, how to eliminate queries using the Hibernate second-level cache, and show some simple but effective tools you can use to monitor and profile your applications.</em></p>

<p>If you are using Hibernate and want to know more about how inheritance affects performance, how to use the second-level cache, and some simple monitoring and profiling techniques, check it out and let me know what you think. Note that NFJS Magazine does require a subscription.</p>
