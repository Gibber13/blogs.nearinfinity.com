title: Micro Benchmarking with Caliper

 From time to time I think all developers have done some form of benchmarking.  I recently discovered <a href="http://code.google.com/p/caliper/" target="new">Caliper</a> which is according to the site -  "Caliper is Google's open-source framework for writing, running and viewing the results of Java Microbenchmarks".  I am aware that micro-benchmarking can be misleading depending on who is writing the tests, but sometimes they are very helpful in getting a feel for how your code is running.
<h3>Background</h3>
Micro benchmarks are dead simple to do.  Get the current time in milliseconds, execute your code, then get the time in milliseconds again and subtract the difference.  So why use a tool like Caliper?  To me Caliper is great because it has a very familiar JUnit type of structure and feel to it. Instead of trying to describe what Caliper does, it's probably easiest to look at a simple example I put together.  I decided to benchmark implementations of Heap Sort,Merge Sort,Quick Sort and the sort method of the java.lang.Arrays class.  Not a terribly original idea I admit, but it was quick to do and it makes the point. <b>NOTE: Package statement and imports left out intentionally for brevity</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
public class SortingBenchmarks extends SimpleBenchmark {
	
	private static final int SIZE = 100000;
	private static final int MAX_VALUE = 80000;
	private int[] values;

	@Override
	protected void setUp() throws Exception {
		values = new int[SIZE];
		Random generator = new Random();
		for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
			values[i] = generator.nextInt(MAX_VALUE);
		}
	}

	public void timeHeapSort(int reps) {
		for (int i = 0; i < reps; i++) {
			HeapSort.sort(values);
		}
	}

	public void timeMergeSort(int reps) {
		for (int i = 0; i < reps; i++) {
			MergeSort.sort(values);
		}
	}
	
	public void timeQuickSort(int reps) {
		for (int i = 0; i < reps; i++) {
			QuickSort.sort(values);
		}
	}

	public void timeArraysSort(int reps) {
		for (int i = 0; i < reps; i++) {
			Arrays.sort(values);
		}
	}
}
</pre>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
Here are the basic steps to writing benchmarks in Caliper:
<ol>
<li>Extend the class SimpleBenchmark</li>
<li>Do any test setup/clean up in respective setUp or tearDown methods (Similar to JUnit setUp/tearDown)</li>
<li>Write the methods that will execute the code to benchmark starting with the word "time" (Again similar to JUnit, just "time" instead of "test")</li>
<li>Place the code you want to benchmark inside your timeSomeOperation methods</li>
</ol>
<h3>Getting and Running Caliper</h3>
To get started with Caliper
<ol>
<li>Go <a href="http://code.google.com/p/caliper/source/checkout" target="new">here</a> to get a read-only svn link to the source code</li>
<li>Check out the code then cd into &lt;CALIPER_INSTALL_DIR&gt; and run ant (obviously you need ant installed and on your path)</li>
</ol>
To actually run your benchmarks there is a bash script included in the project that you can use to run Caliper from the command line.  I took a little different approach as I wanted to run from inside my Eclipse project.
<ol>
<li>In &lt;CALIPER_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/build/caliper-0.0/lib/ there are two jar files, allocation.jar and caliper-0.0.jar.  These will need to be on the classpath of your project.  I chose to create a user library in Eclipse</li>
<li>JUnit will also need to be on the project classpath.  Again for me it's referenced in a user library</li>
<li>I created a driver class that simply executes the main method of the com.google.caliper.Runner class.  I pass in the name of my benchmark class by setting up a run configuration in Eclipse for my driver class</li>
</ol>
Here is the code for my driver class:
<pre class="prettyprint">
package bbejeck.caliper;

public class CaliperRunner {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	com.google.caliper.Runner.main(args[0]);
    }

}
</pre>
After running the driver this is the output received in the Eclipse console screen:
<br/>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Caliper is fairly new and is still has some work to be done, but I think that it's a great tool that could be very useful. Another potentially useful feature is that Caliper can <a href="http://code.google.com/p/caliper/wiki/OnlineResults" target="new">automatically publish your benchmarks.</a>   Full source code for my examples can be found on <a href="https://github.com/bbejeck/CaliperBlog" target="new">github</a>
