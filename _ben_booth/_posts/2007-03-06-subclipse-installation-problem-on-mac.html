Like my development environments, things change.  Since my next project might extend a product written in Java and, since I used to develop Eclipse rich clients in my webMethods days, I figured I'd install Eclipse on my MacBook Pro.
</p>
<p>
We use SVN so, I also installed the most excellent Subclipse Eclipse plug-in.  All was going well until, I tried to synchronize to the repository.  When I did, I got an error.
</p><p>
The console also told me that my "Network connection closed unexpectedly...":<br />
</p>
<p>
After trying several different versions of the Subclipse and hunting around, I discovered this: <a href="http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/a/2005/11/subclipse.html">http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/a/2005/11/subclipse.html</a>.  In my Eclipse SVN preferences (Window &gt; Preferences... &gt; Team &gt; SVN) the SVN Interface "JavaHL (JNI)" was checked by default.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Mark Phippard, I've learned that the JavaHL default is ideal if you're using svn+ssh and you already have JavaHL binaries installed on your OS (more info in the comments to the original post on <a href="http://benjaminbooth.com">www.benjaminbooth.com</a> <a href="http://www.benjaminbooth.com/tableorbooth/2007/03/subclipse_insta.html">here</a>.  Perhaps this is the typical case.  In this scenario, the plug-in will find your svn+ssh config and use your existing credentials.  Cool.
</p>
<p>
However, I didn't have JavaHL installed on my Mac, so no such seamlessness for me.
</p>
<p>
One way to to fix this problem, is to just change the SVN interface to "SVNKit (Pure Java)".  You might also install the JavaHL binaries for your OS (and configure for your SSH credentials), in which case Subclipse's default option will work just fine.  If you're in my boat, using the SVNKit option and re-entering them in the ensuing dialog is probably your best bet.
