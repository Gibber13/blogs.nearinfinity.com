<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse; "><p>Having just completed a week of SharePoint Power User training, one thing is evident -- I am far from being a Power User. What they should call the class is SharePoint User Tapas. Trainees get just a little taste of all that SharePoint can do. It's enough to make us say "Ooh, I love this," and "I'm not so crazy about that." I can certainly see the benefits of implementing SharePoint in an organization, and I also understand the dangers if it is not done well. This leads me to one conclusion -- don't be afraid to think big, but start small. Choose one business problem to focus on, make sure it's one you think you can get your organization to buy in to, and go from there. It is not very likely that SharePoint will be the best solution for every business problem that you have.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; ">Training always leaves you with a head full ideas for how to implement solutions based on the new knowledge you have gained. It's like meeting a new love interest for the first time -- you think of all of the things that "could be," but you have to go on a lot of dates before you can sort out what is reality versus fantasy in terms of your expectations.</p></span>
