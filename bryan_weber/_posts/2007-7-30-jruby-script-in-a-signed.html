OK, let's dive into the world of JRuby a little further, specifically let's touch on the boundary between Java and JRuby again.  One excellent way to run JRuby for certain situations is to put the JRuby code (along with some Java code) in a signed, executable jar.  A fairly common reason to do this would be the following: you want to run some ruby code (in the JVM) and you want to make sure that no one modifies the contents of the JRuby file (thus you sign the jar).  Of course this does not offer you perfect protection, but it adds another layer making it more difficult to subvert your efforts.  For the time being, I will assume that you have JDK 1.5 and not JDK 1.6... which means that the scripting framework is not available to you.  So, simply include the JRuby jar file in your classpath and jar up the following class along with your ruby files.  You should be sure to sign the jar when you create it and you should add pkg.JRubyRunner as your main class so the jar file is executable.  Then executing "java -cp jruby.jar -jar MyJar.jar" will run your jruby code AND since the jar file is signed no one will be able to modify your ruby files!  (Again, with some effort of course a hacker could modify the ruby file if they had access to the jar.) 

<pre class="prettyprint">package pkg;

import org.jruby.Main;

public class JRubyRunner {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    runJRubyScript("ipc.rb", args);
  }

  public static void runJRubyScript(String name, String... args) {
    // modify the args for jruby
    String[] args2 = new String[2 + args.length];
    if (args.length &gt; 0) {
      System.arraycopy(args, 0, args2, 2, args.length);
    }
    args2[0] = "-e";
    args2[1] = "require '" + name + "'";
    // execute the ruby script
    Main.main(args2);
  }
}

</pre>


Now, for a few subtle points that you may have missed, especially considering the simplicity of the code.  For starters, why you may ask, not just pass in the name of the ruby file?  Why use the -e option at all?  Well, the reason is because the ruby file is located in the jar file so it is not accessible via java.io.File which JRuby uses to load the file.  This makes perfect sense.  And since it defeats the purpose to move the ruby file outside of the signed jar, we must find another way to get this to work.  You could read in the entire contents of the file from the classpath and pass it into the -e option, but this is ugly and extremely prone to error, so we take advantage of an excellent feature of 'require' in JRuby.  Require loads its files from the classpath.  This is excellent, because it means that if we require just the file we want to run, it will be loaded from the classpath and and subsequent requires will be loaded from the classpath as well.
