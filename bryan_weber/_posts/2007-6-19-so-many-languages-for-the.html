Java, Jython, BeanShell, JRuby, Groovy, Scala... with so many languages available for the JVM now, how do I know which one is right for me?  Language selection is becoming a design consideration that architects have to take into consideration.  Language selection is becoming part of the answer to the question "How am I going to accomplish...?"  When thinking about how to accomplish something, it often helps to think about "What am I trying to accomplish?" and "Why am I trying to accomplish it?"

Some things to consider:

<ul>
<li>Strongly Typed?</li>
<li>Does implementation lag another language/specification?</li>
<li>Object Oriented/Functional/Procedural/etc?</li>
<li>Level of support required?</li>
<li>Level of expertise available?</li>
<li>Life expectancy?</li>
<li>Language features (Closures, native Regex support, etc) required/desired?</li>
<li>Performance requirements?</li>
<li>Ease of interaction with other JVM languages/libraries?</li>
<li>Re-usability by other JVM languages/libraries?</li>
<li>Ease of use?</li>
<li>Ease of readability?</li>
<li>What tools/support/debugging options are available?</li>
<li>Should I wait for invokedynamic byte code instruction?</li>
</ul>{% endraw %}
