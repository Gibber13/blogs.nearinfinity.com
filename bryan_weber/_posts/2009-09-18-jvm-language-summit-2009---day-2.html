Terrance Parr - ANTLR<div><br /></div><div>Terrance is entertaining and energetic. &nbsp;He showed some of the challenges ANTLR faces and had some requests from the JVM that are slightly different from most of the language implementors.</div><div><br /></div><div>Stadler - JVM Continuations</div><div><br /></div><div>Another research talk. &nbsp;The definition of continuations caused a side discussion, but I really enjoyed this talk. &nbsp;It is only implemented in the c1 client compiler. &nbsp;Security (serialization) and finally blocks are some of the unanswered questions here.</div><div><br /></div><div>Wimmer - trace-based JIT</div><div><br /></div><div>More research (UC-Irvine, but really more from Linz). &nbsp;Discussed TCO, client compiler visualization tool and trace based JIT. &nbsp;Uses traces and not just heuristics to identify hotspots for compilation. &nbsp;Works with blocks as well as methods. &nbsp;Think tracemonkey for Hotspot.</div><div><br /></div><div>Gafter - Static dynamic types</div><div><br /></div><div>Neal spoke about the new dynamic keyword in C# and the DLR. &nbsp;Described the DLR as basically a MOP. &nbsp;I would love to see a clean language implementation on the JVM with this sort of type system.</div><div><br /></div><div>Siek - Blame tracking</div><div><br /></div><div>Blame tracking is tracking type problems in dynamic languages and blaming the proper point in the code that made the initial improper call. &nbsp;It also works for mixed static/dynamic type systems. &nbsp;Currently it only identifies the outmost problem for space efficiency reasons.</div><div><br /></div><div>Field - JavaFX binding</div><div><br /></div><div>Bindings are handled by the creation of locations which can be pretty inefficient. &nbsp;This talk went through the various rounds of attempting to make bindings fast(er).</div><div><br /></div><div>Baker - Jython</div><div><br /></div><div>History of Jython. &nbsp;Optimizations. &nbsp;Mostly discussed the libraries and future direction.</div><div><br /></div><div>Remi Forax - 292 (invoke dynamic aka indy) backport</div><div><br /></div><div>Backport works via proxies and code weaving since the byte code instruction is not available. &nbsp;Two transformations occur via Java agents and the performance is very respectable. &nbsp;It works with JDK 5 and 6.</div><div><br /></div><div>The final session (not recorded) was by Slava on the Factor programming language compiler. Factor is a stack based language like Forth that does NOT run on the JVM. &nbsp;This session was awesome. &nbsp;While there weren't any new compiler optimizations that I hadn't heard of previously, it is very impressive was Slava has done with Factor. &nbsp;If you haven't ever checked it out, the url is&nbsp;<a href="http://factorcode.org/">http://factorcode.org/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, kudos to Sun for inviting non-JVM participants, it really adds to the quality of the event imho.</div><div><br /></div><div>PS Linux doesn't work well for presentations. :)</div><div>PPS People want TCO</div><div>PPPS 64k byte limit in methods is a problem</div><div>PPPPS The amount of cooperation among projects seems to have increased significantly since last year</div><div>PPPPPS Startup time needs to be improved</div>
