Day 1 of the 2nd annual JVM language summit at Sun Microsystems has come to a close. &nbsp;Once again this conference has had excellent content in the presentations. &nbsp;My overall impression of today was that many projects (JRuby, Atilla's MOP, etc) already have done significant work on integrating invoke dynamic.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>And once again Sun was smart enough to invite non-JVM participants. &nbsp;Today was Allison Randal from Parrot. &nbsp;Tomorrow will include Erik Meijer of Microsoft and Haskell fame. I would love to see him top his presentation from last year, it will be difficult.<div><br /></div><div>Charlie Nutter (of Engine Yard, still not quite used to that) talked about JRuby, Duby and Surinx. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Mark Reinhold talked about the JDK, Atilla spoke about his MOP framework, Miles Sabin spoke about Scala tooling, and David Pollack spoke about Scala basics.<br /><div><br /></div><div>The JVM presentations were interesting, but the best material was at dinner. &nbsp;Sorry to non-attendees, that won't be on InfoQ later.</div><div><br /></div><div>John Rose's breakout session was the highlight of Day 1 for me. &nbsp;It is really fun to think about the parts of the implementation of Method Handles that do not have solutions yet or where certain features could be taken in the future.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>One of the breakout sessions was on Noop.&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/noop/">http://code.google.com/p/noop/</a>&nbsp;This reminded me of the Fan programming language from last year's event. &nbsp;Only Fan has a real implementation and noop is more or less in the vaporware phase at this point in time. &nbsp;The two goals of noop are easy testing (even of legacy code) and readability. &nbsp;As conceived today it is not going to achieve either to the degree the implementors would like IMHO. &nbsp;It almost reminds me of turning Guice into a programming language...</div><div><br /></div><div>Oh yeah, and if you didn't already know, Brian Goetz knows a lot about concurrency. &nbsp;A whole lot. &nbsp;He was able to detect a concurrency bug in sample code that fit on one slide after a few seconds of reading it. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Tomorrow's schedule is jam packed with presentations that interest me. &nbsp;Will post more tomorrow night!</div></div></div>
