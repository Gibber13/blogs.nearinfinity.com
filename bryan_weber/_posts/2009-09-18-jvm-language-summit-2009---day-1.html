<div>While day 1 focused on invokedynamic day 2 focused on time and locality. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div>Hickey keynote<div><br /></div><div>Very thought provoking. &nbsp;Argued for immutable data structures and pure functions, but with time transitions and observers. &nbsp;Nice pragmatic response in a way to Erik Meijer's Fundamentalist Functional Programming from last year's JVM language Summit. &nbsp;This was somewhat a philosophical presentation, but much like last year it made me want to re-visit Clojure. &nbsp;Here is a better summary than I could have written:&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.jvmlangsummit.com/Clojure_Keynote">http://wiki.jvmlangsummit.com/Clojure_Keynote</a></div><div><br /><div>Cliff Click</div><div><br /></div><div>Awesome scheduling to put this immediately after Rich's talk. &nbsp;Cliff offered up four presentations and the audience overwhelmingly chose the one about x86. &nbsp;Interestingly this had some similar theories to Rich's talk (time and locality), but at an extremely low level.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hotswap</div><div><br /></div><div>Research presentation from European students that have partnered with Sun. &nbsp;This was interesting, but the limitations make it not that useful for real production code hotswapping in my opinion.</div><div><br /></div><div>Groovy</div><div><br /></div><div>This talk by Theodorou focused on the performance of Groovy and was almost an advertisement for not using Groovy. &nbsp;Of course the performance of Groovy doesn't match Java, but it is really bad in some instances. &nbsp;The moral was use Java where performance is necessary.</div><div><br /></div><div>Sun update</div><div><br /></div><div>This was probably not recorded, but Octavian took hard questions from Josh Bloch, Neal Gafter and others. &nbsp;Hopefully the departure of key Sun employees ends up helping Sun in the long run. &nbsp;In my opinion Sun is overestimating the value of the Java store.</div><div><br /></div><div>Erik Meijer</div><div><br /></div><div>Not nearly as entertaining as last year's talk, but still interesting and based on mathematics. &nbsp;Erik was looking for solutions to concurrency and resource cleanup problems that are difficult and that currently have no "clean" solution.</div><div><br /></div><div>JRocket</div><div><br /></div><div>Frederik's talk focused mostly on anti-optimizations and basically asked the language designers to not try to implement optimizations that are also performed by the JVM. &nbsp;The audience was hoping for specific patterns more than Frederik offered up, but Frederik is clearly very knowledgeable about JRocket and the JVM specification.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ioke</div><div><br /></div><div>Ola tried to give a one hour introduction to Ioke in 30 minutes and by his own admission it did not work out that well. &nbsp;Many in the audience were not familiar with the syntax of IO which originally inspired Ioke and that did not help him very much. &nbsp;The BNF was shown much more than actual source examples.</div><div><br /></div><div>Dinner</div><div><br /></div><div>Dinner was at Faultine which has good food and terrible acoustics. &nbsp;Aside from having to scream at the people sitting near me it was a brilliant time. &nbsp;Dick Wall of the Java Posse was very friendly and a fantastic ambassador for the Java/Scala community. &nbsp;If you aren't familiar with the Java Posse podcast then I suggest you check it out on iTunes or at&nbsp;<a href="http://javaposse.com/">http://javaposse.com/</a>. Their google group and mailing list are also interesting.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
