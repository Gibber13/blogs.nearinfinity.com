Day 1 of RubyConf 2007 is complete.  Highlights of the day for me were:

<br />
<ul>
<li>Jim Weirich's presentation on Advanced Ruby Class Design</li>
<li>Nathan Sobo's presentation on Treetop</li>
<li>Ryan Davis' presentation on Hurting Code for Fun and Profit</li>
</ul>

<br />
Advanced Ruby Class Design

<br /><br />
Well done presentation specifically tailored to developers coming from Java or C#.  Included examples from some of the most mature ruby libraries around.  Jim wanted to present examples that were fun and interesting and he delivered.

<br /><br />
Treetop

<br /><br />
I had to choose between this presentation and ropes.  I'd still like to learn more about ropes someday, but I'm really glad I went to this presentation.  Treetop isn't for everyeone, but I love the ideas behind Treetop and I can't wait until it is slightly more mature (and [better] documented). I've already downloaded the gem (and facets as it is required) and played with Treetop a little.  My first impression is that it does not work in JRuby 1.0.1 at all which is unfortunate.  I'm not sure if this is a JRuby bug, a problem with something in facets or a problem with Treetop itself. <b>UPDATE Recently released JRuby version 1.1b1 fixes the problem so it was a JRuby bug.</b>  Hopefully Treetop will be replacing Gold Parser Builder and antlr in my mythical developers toolbox soon.  This project embodies the ruby community for me, it is approaching a very old problem in a very new way (admittedly Nathan isn't the idea originator, but who is doing parsing this way in the Java/.NET world?) and a very ruby way.

<br /><br />
Hurting Code for Fun and Profit

<br /><br />
A non-technical presentation, but very entertaining and relevant presentation nonetheless.  I almost passed on this presentation because I thought the presentation was oddly named and the extract contained words like "ascetic" which I did not know the meaning of.  And the reference to "for fund and profit" ("Smashing the stack for fun and profit" being the reference, at least, that's the first reference to "for fun and profit" that I'm aware of) didn't really seem to make sense either.  So what exactly is hurting code?  Well, it turns out that it is hurting (refactoring/re-writing/modifying) code that you do not like instead of hurting the offending developer(s).  Code that "you do not like" is very open to interpretation and Ryan basically defined it as code that doesn't sit well with you (instinctual) as opposed to some concise algorithmic approach.  The presentation did mention a couple of tools (all developed by Ryan I believe) that could potentially help detect code that probably should not sit well with you, but they were not really the focus of the presentation.

Looking forward to day 2!
