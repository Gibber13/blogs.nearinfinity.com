<h2>JVM Language Summit - Day 1</h2>

<p>Day 1 of the JVM language summit in Santa Clara has come and gone.  The agenda can be found at <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/mlvm/jvmlangsummit/agenda.html">Agenda</a>.
</p>


<p>
The highlight of day 1 for me was John Rose talking about invokedynamic.  A lot of attendees really liked the talks about Fortress and multiple dispatch, but invokedynamic was the most relevant to me.  And best of all a Sun employee said that invokedynamic would be part of Java 7.  Now, that doesn't mean anything, but it is encouraging to hear that Sun is committed to getting it included in Java 7.
</p>

<p>
The surprise of the day for me was the presentation on Fan.  I had not heard of fan prior to signing up for the event.  It seems like it is still pretty immature, but it is interesting.  The language is being created from the ground up to run on the JVM and CLR.  They have spent most of their time making libraries that can be built on top of both platforms. The big problem is that you can't call out to the multitudes of libraries available on those platforms.  This is a show stopper for now.

<p>
Stu's lightning talk started the best conversation of the day.  The open sessions, or unconference or whatever term you prefer, were not nearly as successful at getting people talking about issues as Stu's presentation.  The conversation focused on how libraries can be provided on the JVM in the best of breed language for that particular problem and just as importantly how the library can be used by other languages on the JVM.  This second part is the part that there is no clear answer for right now.  Clojure's collections and the regex library in JRuby were used as examples of libraries that could be shared by lots of languages implemented on the JVM.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hotspot - Just an intro to the event.</li>
<li>invokedynamic - Read <a href="http://blog.headius.com/2008/09/first-taste-of-invokedynamic.html">headius' blog</a> if you'd like to know more.</li>
<li>Maxine - An experimental VM.  Not compliant yet.  Has an API.</li>
<li>Fan - new language to run on JVM and CLR.</li>
<li>Groovy - Intro to Groovy</li>
<li>Scala - Focused on one aspect of Scala</li>
<li>Fortress - Fortran on the JVM with concurrency, lots of it.  They came the most prepared to make recommendations to Sun of features that could be added to the JVM.  The list contained things like continuations, value objects, etc.</li>
<li>Multiple dispatch - Professor's implementation of how multiple dispatch could be done on the JVM quickly and without too much disruption.</li>
</ul>
