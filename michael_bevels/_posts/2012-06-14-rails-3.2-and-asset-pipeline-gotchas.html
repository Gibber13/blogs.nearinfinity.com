title: Rails 3.2 and Asset Pipeline Gotchas
tags: ruby
---
<p>
Recently I upgraded a Rails 3.0 application to Rails 3.2.  Part of
this task involved configuring the application to fully utilize the
asset pipeline, which means the assets (javascript and stylesheets)
would need to be precompiled before deploying the application.  I read
through a few guides and it looked easy enough, but there were a few
"gotchas" that required some debugging.
</p>

<h2>
Issue 1: Initialize on Precompile
</h2>

<p>
The first issue stemmed from the following asset pipeline
configuration parameter: "config.assets.initialize_on_precompile".  By
default, this configuration parameter is set to true.  However, if you
precompile assets for your test and production environments on your
local machine before deployment, you may not be able to connect to
those environments' databases and/or other dependencies.  Other steps
that occur during initialization for those environments may
potentially fail as well.
</p>

<p>
The top results from a quick google search will tell you to simply set
that configuration parameter to false.  Precompile your assets without
initializing the application.  Sounds simple enough and this may work
for your application.  However, it may just cause you more problems.
Does your local environment have a different context root than your
test and production environments?  Do important steps happen during
initialization that are environment specific such as javascript route
generation?  If that's the case, you should keep
"initialize_on_precompile" turned on.
</p>

<p>
One potential work-around is inserting conditional "unless
ENV['RAILS_GROUPS'] == 'assets' " statements throughout your code.
When you run the rake task, 'rake assets:precompile', behind the
scenes the RAILS_GROUPS environment variable is set to 'assets'.
Conditionally checking for the existence and value of this environment
variable can allow you execute or not execute certain bits of code.
However, this solution may not always work or you may not actually
want these conditional statements throughout your code.
</p>

<p>
Another option (and my choice) is to create a special 'asset'
environment file.  In your application_root/config/environments
directory, you probably already have development.rb, test.rb, and
production.rb files (or some variation of those environment files).
Why not create a bare-bones "deploy-assets.rb" environment file that
only has the stuff you need to precompile your assets?  You can leave
"config.assets.initialize_on_precompile" set to true and not have to
litter your code with the previously mentioned conditional statements.
 If you go this route, you'll simply call "rake
RAILS_ENV='deploy-assets' assets:precompile" to precompile your
assets.
</p>

<h2>
Issue 2: Rails Relative URL Root
</h2>

<p>
I mentioned above that my local development environment has a
different context root than the test and production environments.  If
different a context root is something that you need to account for
when the application is initialized, you need to set
RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT when calling the assets:precompile task.  The
complete command would look something like this:  "rake
RAILS_ENV='deploy-assets' RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT='/applicationRoot'
assets:precompile", where "applicationRoot" is the your application's
context root.  It's a simple and easy fix, but I didn't see it
mentioned in any of the asset pipeline guides that I read through.
</p>

<h2>
Issue 3:  Verify your assets actually precompiled
</h2>

<p>
A certain javascript rich text editor gave me some issues.  I thought
I'd include it in the app/assets/javascript directory and have it
precompiled with the rest of the assets.  I ran "rake
assets:precompile --trace" and it appeared that everything had worked
(no stack trace, no visible errors).  I even did a quick scan of the
freshly generated public/assets directory and saw the newly created
javascript, images, and stylesheets.  However, a css file within the
javascript rich text editor directory was causing assets:precompile to
fail before completion without raising an exception.  This became
evident when I started the server and pages raised exceptions that
certain assets couldn't be found.  The root of the issue was the
following line "{filter:;}" within a css file.
</p>

<p>
If you precompile the assets and it appears to succeed, but you're
seeing "resource not found" exceptions, asset precompilation may be
failing silently.
</p>

<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>

<p>
I like the asset pipeline.  My application's home page requests were
cut in half due to the condensed application.js and application.css
files which in turn improved speed.  The few issues I mentioned above
aren't hard to overcome, but they did take some time to track down.
Hopefully if you're experiencing the same issues, you will find these
tips helpful.
