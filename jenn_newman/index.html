<p>After double majoring in Computer Science and Political Science at
Tufts University, Jenn joined Near Infinity as a software engineer in
2009.  At NIC she's used a variety of technologies, including ASP.NET
MVC, SharePoint, Ruby on Rails, jQuery, and several database
management systems.  With a knack for design and a passion for clean
code, she develops elegantly architected back ends with delightful
user-interface sugar on top.
