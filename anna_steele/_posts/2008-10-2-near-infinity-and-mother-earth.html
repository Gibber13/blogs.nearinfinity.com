<p>That's right, NIC has made a best-friend-forever by treating our planet with the respect that it deserves (and it just sounds more fun than "Near Infinity is Going Green!"). When we moved into our new facility in April, not only were we ecstatic to have our own office space, but we were also thrilled to have the ability to focus on the following green office initiatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vegetable Plastic Cutlery (compostable)</li>
<li>Hot Cups with a Bio-Plastic Inner Lining (compostable)</li>
<li>PLA Plastic Corn Cold Cups (compostable)</li>
<li>Sugarcane Plates and Bowls (biodegradable)</li>
<li>Recycled Napkins and Paper Towels</li>
<li>100% Recycled Cup Sleeves (compostable)</li>
<li>Recycled Trash Bags</li>
<li>Recycling Program for Paper, Cardboard, Bottles and Cans</li>
<li>Recycled Paper and Other Office Supplies</li>
<li>Energy Saving Compact Fluorescent (CFL) Light Bulbs</li>
<li>Organic Snacks (when available)</li>
</ul>

<p>We also embrace these green initiatives outside of our new office walls by declining non-green alternatives whenever possible. At our latest company picnic, we brought our own Eco-Products cups, plates, utensils, etc. We plan to continue to find better ways to treat our environment, and to contribute to a better future for our families.</p>

<h2>Some Green Facts:</h2>

<p><i>When you buy green alternative products you really are making a difference. Here are a few green facts concerning the products our customers buy and how these products help conserve natural resources and reduce dependency on foreign oil. In one year, Eco-Products customers make a difference by saving:</i></p>

<ul>
<li><i>742,414 gallons of gasoline - enough to drive around the earth 673 times.</i></li>
<li><i>13,478,914 pounds of greenhouse gases</i></li>
<li><i>8,629,476 kW hours of energy - enough to power the average American household for 810 years</i></li>
</ul>

<p><i>Vegetable starch and sugarcane are eco-friendly alternatives to plastic and tree Paper:</i></p>

<ul>
<li><i>Mature every season</i></li>
<li><i>100% compostable</i></li>
<li><i>Petroleum free, non-toxic</i></li>
<li><i>Breaks down in 45-120 days under certain conditions (heat, moisture, movement)</i></li>
</ul>

<p><i>Conventional products made from petroleum can sometimes be recycled, but most of them end up going to a landfill. Because landfills are specifically designed to NOT allow waste to break down, everything that goes to a landfill will take thousands of years to decompose.  Eco-Products helps the environment by using renewable resources that greatly reduce the amount of waste going to landfills by creating compostable products.  According to a study done by Penn State University, 34 percent of landfill waste is composted organic material and 33 percent is paper. Thus, 67 percent of total landfill waste can be easily composted and diverted.</i></p>
