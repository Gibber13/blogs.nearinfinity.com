Ever since he started typing programs from computer manuals into his dad's Apple IIc plus, Ed has been fascinated with computing machines. Upon graduating from St. Bonaventure University in 1998 with a double major in finance and computer science, thinking programming was still just his hobby, he began the search for a job in the finance industry. Luckily, he couldn't find one; so he took a job in the IT industry in Northern Virginia instead. He has been happily developing software ever since.

When he's not writing software, Ed spends a good deal of time enhancing his understanding of the foundations of computing. His continued pursuit of this goal recently rewarded him with a BS in math from George Mason University.

Ed lives in Northern Virginia with his beloved Sarah. Their house is also home to a trio of pets: two very laid back cats (Miles and Cricket) and one moderately hyperactive dog (Hattie).
