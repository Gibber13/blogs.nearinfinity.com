<div>
<p>
	After reading <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon.skeet/default.aspx">John Skeet's blog</a> about <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon.skeet/archive/2007/10/03/linq-to-silliness-generating-a-mandelbrot-with-parallel-potential.aspx">Generating Mandelbrot images using PLINQ</a>
	I got the idea to build my own LINQ extension. Instead of just splitting the work across processors like PLINQ does, 
	I decided to split it across machines as well. Thus was born RemoteLINQ. The concept is simple, take each item from an
	enumeration and send it to a remote machine for processing. From a users perspective it is just that easy. The magic behind
	the curtains is not. Handling threading, ordering, communication, etc. was and still is difficult. The code I provide is still very beta and I cannot guarantee it won't blow up, but it's getting better and it does generates Mandelbrot
	images just fine across 3 machines containing a total of 5 processors.
</p>
</div>
<p>
</p><h2>Code You Write To Make It Work</h2>
	Here is an example of what you as a user of RemoteLINQ would need to do:
<div class="csharpcode code">
<pre style="overflow: auto;"><span class="lnum">   1:  </span>IEnumerable&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt; numbers = Enumerable.Range(0, 500);
<span class="lnum">   2:  </span>RemoteContext remoteContext = <span class="kwrd">new</span> RemoteContext(
<span class="lnum">   3:  </span>   <span class="kwrd">new</span>[] { <span class="kwrd">this</span>.GetType().Assembly }, 
<span class="lnum">   4:  </span>   <span class="kwrd">new</span>[] { <span class="str">"localhost"</span>, <span class="str">"someremotehost"</span> },
<span class="lnum">   5:  </span>   7776);
<span class="lnum">   6:  </span>RemoteOptions remoteOptions = <span class="kwrd">new</span> RemoteOptions();
<span class="lnum">   7:  </span>IEnumerable&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt; results = numbers.AsRemotable(remoteContext, remoteOptions).Select(i =&gt; DoSomeWork(i));</pre></div><br />
	This will take the numbers 0 to 500 and send half of the numbers to "localhost" and half of the numbers to "someremotehost"
	for processing.
<p></p>
<p>
	Let's walk through the code.
	</p><ul>
		<li><b>Line 1</b>, gives us an enumerable of numbers from 0 to 500 for processing.</li>
		<li><b>Line 2</b>, creates the RemoteContext. This is really just a client which has a list of server connections to which we can send work.</li>
		<li><b>Line 3</b>, is a list of assemblies that contain the necessary code to run your LINQ statement. The client will actually send 
					a copy of the dll	to the RemoteLINQ server so that the server will have a copy of the "DoSomeWork" (line 7) method so 
					that it can execute it.</li>
		<li><b>Line 4</b>, is the list of servers to divvy the work across.</li>
		<li><b>Line 5</b>, is just the port that the client will try to connect to the server on.</li>
		<li><b>Line 6</b>, contains any options to direct how the work gets split across the servers, etc.</li>
		<li><b>Line 7</b>, is your LINQ statement. Notice the "AsRemotable". This is where all the magic starts.
					This will actually return a IRemoteEnumerable which knows how to take anything to the right of
					it and run it remotely.
	</li></ul>
	Lines 2-6 can be put into some fields somewhere and be reused across multiple RemoteLINQ calls. This will actually
	buy you a couple things. First, you will only have one connection to the server. Second, only one copy of your assemblies
	will be sent across to the server.<br /><br />

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
	Lets start out with what lambda expression look like in compiled code. When we compile lambda expressions they are moved into a
	new method with a compiler generated name. If you reflect on a class with lambdas and get all the methods on that type you will see
	a bunch of method names which you didn't create. Those are your lambdas. The fact that they are first class methods allows us
	from the outside, with reflection of course, to call those methods. So when we call "Select" on an IRemoteEnumerable,
	RemoteLINQ is taking the lambda expression passed in, and storing information about it into a serializable object (assembly, 
	declaring type, method name, etc.). This will allow us to send that information to the server, who can then call the method
	without all the other stuff around it.
</p>
<p>
	On the server side of things, when we start up a RemoteLINQ server, it will create a worker thread for each processor in the machine.
	The worker thread will wait quietly until new work arrives on the socket connection. When work arrives we take the serialized object
	I mentioned before and find the assembly, type, and method and execute that method with the work given to us. In this case the work will
	be one of the numbers from 0 to 500. The client will handle load balancing the servers by choosing the server with the least amount of pending
	work per processor. The amount of work queued up on the server is sent back after each unit of work is completed so that the client
	will have the most up to date picture of what the servers are doing to make the best guess as to where to send the next piece of work.
</p>
<p>
	That's about it. You now have a way to split complex LINQ tasks across multiple machine with just a single call on your LINQ statement.
